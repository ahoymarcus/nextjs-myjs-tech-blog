### Introduction

The requirements engineering refers to the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements for a software development project.

In a more specific term, the requirements engineering is the discipline to apply pattern, methods and notation to describe a proposed system, its intended functionalities and associated constraints.

And it is described in the JavaTPoint tutorial with these processes:

1. **Feasibility Study**: the study for appling reasoning for the project implementation.       
	1.1. To acceptable to the users    
	1.2. To be flexible to change     
	1.3. To be in the conformation with established standards     
2. **Requirement Elicitation and Analysis**: also known as **gathering of requirements** and is applied with the help of customers and existing system processes.
	2.1. Starts with the proposal and the indentification of problems.
	2.2. Classifying
	2.3. Priorizing 
	2.4. Resolution of conflicts
	2.5. Validation
3. **Software Requirement Specfication**: this is a technical document written by a analyst after the collectiong of requirements and the requirement received by the client.
	3.1. Here the analyst will be using many kind of documents to represent the technical data as: Data Flow Diagrams, Data Dictionaries, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, etc...
4. **Software Requirement Validation**: this is a set of necessary validations to delve deeper into the requirements to check.
	4.1. To see if they are practical to implement, if they are correct in functionality, not ambigous, etc...
	4.2. There can be used a variaty of methods like Manual analysis, Prototyping, application of Test-cases, and Automated consistency analysis.
5. **Software Requirement Management**: the importance of this last process is due to the concrete fact that business needs may change during the project, just as the requirements may undergo changes in priority and objective, etc...


### Types of Software Requirements

Usualy, the software requirements are divided and categorized into two groups:

1. **Functional Requirements**: these are requirements that describes some behaviour of the system and its functionalities.
2. **Non-functional Requirements**: these are requirements that specify some criteria of the operation instead of some specific behavior of the system.
	2.1. Execution qualities: requirements mainly seem in run time, like security and usability.
	2.2. Evolution qualities: these are considered static requirements of the structure of the sytem, like testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, etc...
