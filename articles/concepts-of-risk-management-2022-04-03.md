### Introduction
 
Risks are events that take part in the everryday live, and while some are dim and may not cause dismay, others may disrupt some activities and even completetly aborts them.

In this sense, it could be wise that enterprise would try to process this kind of events, specially those that are bigger in the market place. And it is with this notion that the site [Bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/risk-management/) brings an enterprise guideline like ISO 31000 as some base for a risk management process, say that a **risk** is the effect of uncertainty on objectives.


For that reason, it is important that organizations may bring effort to understand those risks and how they may affect their objectives, since there are a lot of investiment being made.


Also, as uncertainties go, the risks can affect in two ways:

1. **Negative risks effects**
2. **Positive risks effects**


And though even positive risks may be felt as a welcome element to the company, one would say that things should not be left for chance, or at least to say that the organization should make a proper assess into that change event.


So, while talking about risk management two important points should be made:

1. **Even If the event or risk is positive, it should be assessed by the organization in order to be better understood and also booted.**
2. **If the effect is negative, there should also be two possibilities**:   
    2.1. To try to manage preventive measures.   
    2.2. To try to manage mitigation measures.

### Risk Management

As a process, **risk management** is an effort to minimize or mitigate risks, as it starts with the identification and evaluation of risk followed by optiaml use of resources to monitor and minimize the same.


And now, as an general rule risk comes from uncertainty, and when he risk is assessed in the organizations the uncertainty is linked to the company's participation on the market place:

- **demand**
- **supply**
- **stock market**
- **projects**
- **accidents**
- **natural disasters**


And just as the risks can derive from a variaty of places, they also can be evaluated in two different ways:

1. **The probability of occurence for certain risk scenario.**
2. **The amount of impact or damage it can cause.**


`A successful risk assessment program must meet legal, contractual, internal, social and ethical goals, as well as monitor new technology-related regulations. By focusing attention on risk and committing the necessary resources to control and mitigate risk, a business will protect itself from uncertainty, reduce costs and increase the likelihood of business continuity and success.` [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/risk-management)


This subject is so important to enterprises that many standards and frameworks define Risk Management in their processes:

###### ISO 31000

`Coordinated activities to direct and contol an organization with regard to risk` 

###### ITIL® 4 

It `outlines the purpose of the risk management practice is to ensure that the organization understands and effectively handles risk to guarantee ongoing sustainability and value co-creation` [Bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/risk-management/)



#### Principles of Risk Management
    
Another interesting point on the introduction from [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/risk-management.htm) is the fact that there are risk management principles laid from many standards or framework, and the site then brings a set of principles taken from:

- **Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)**
- **ISO standards**

1. **Organizational Context**: this principle states that each organization has its own specifiies in their context that have to be accounted for risk management.   
    1.1. Exemples of context: the organization internal arrangement, local environment, organization culture, technological capacity, legal, etc.
2. **Involvement of Stakeholders**: they should be involved in the decision making, be aware of changes of policies, and even play some role when it could make sense for the operation.     
3. **Organizational Objectives**: while dealing with risks and uncertainty, the organization should always have the strategic objectives in mind and keep the big picture.
4. **Reporting**: that communication is a key factor in risk management, and a related consequence from this is the necessity to have also a process of authenticity of the information.    
    4.1. So, decision should be made on best available information, with transparency and visibility.
5. **Roles and Responsabilities**: that risk management has to be transparent and inclusive, and also take in account human factors, ensuring that each one knows its roles and responsabilities.
6. **Support Structure**: the support structure in the organization underlines the work of the risk management team/department, and should be able to ensure dynamic, diligent and responsive relation to the personel in charge of risk management.   
    6.1. Also, the people involved should be understand and be aware of their intervention at each stage of the risk management process.
7. **Early Warning Indicators**: there should a continous effort to process risk management, specially to deal with events at early stages, before a active problem should appear.   
    7.1. So, reliable communications at each level and engagement from the parties involved and each one of them knowing their part in the process.
8. **Review Cycle**: keep evaluating inputs at each step of the risk management process: **Identify**, **Assess**, **Respond**, and **Review**.   
    8.1. Analyse and identify reasonalbe interventions and remove unnecessary ones.
9. **Supportive Culture**: awareness and participation should help to motivate and bring people to participate more.
10. **Continual Improvement**: to be capabe of improving and enhancing the risk management strategies and tactics.   
    10.1. To use the learning experiences to access to imrprove the way the ongoing risk is focused and managed.


#### Key Elements in Risk Management According to ITIL 4

Though a risk management process is not a matter of completely avoiding negative outcomes, there are some key features for ther framework ITIL 4 that may direct to a success operation:

- **Establishing governance of risk management**
- **Nuturing a risk management culture and identifying risks**
- **Analyzing and evaluating risks**
- **Treating, monitoring, and reviweing risks**


#### Risk Management Life Cycle

So, summing up all that information, in term to optimize its own performance, the risk management process not only implies a life cycle to the entire process, but it also maintain a continous assessment of the risk problem. Finally, it also classify the possible actions depending on the significance of its impacts.

- Though the terminology may vary a little bit, here is some way to refer to **Risk Management Life Cycle**
1. **Assess**: identify potential risks.   
    1.1. The possible source for the risk.   
    1.2. The problem that may be caused by that specific risk.
2. **Evaluate**: define each risk according its potential impact.
3. **Manage**: the tasks and actions to deal with the problem.   
    3.1. Monitoring   
    3.2. Managing 
4. **Measure**: evaluate the results and restart the a new cycle.


#### Risk Management Priorities Assessment    

While dealing with risk management, it is important to assess first the understanding of the risks, because it's not only the concret risk at hand, but also some underlining features that will help to better classify its nature:

1. **Risk source**: what number and kind of elements come together to create the risk condition. And from where are they more like to come.   
    1.1. Perhaps each element may come from different origins and then come together to create some riks factor.
2. **Risk event**: this should be a catalog of potential occurences or changes, both internally or externally that could turn out as a risk event.
3. **Risk consequence**: to know also the potential outcome of some risks.  
    3.1. For instance, lost revenue, penalties from a regulator, disrupted operations, currupted data, etc.
4. **Risk likelihood**: to assess the probability of something happening, and document it as Low, Medium or High pattern.


And once the kinds of risks are assessed, it is important to define actions to be addressed in each of the cases:

1. **Risk avoidance**: it can be any action to be taken in order to avoid some risk occurence.   
    1.1. For example, to stop some investiment, change some development feature, close some product line, etc.
2. **Risk reduction**: it means acceptance of some of the risk involved, but taking actions to try to minimize evetual loss and preventing it to spread in the operation.   
    2.1. For example, implementing Health Insurance in the company.
3. **Risk sharing**: this kind of action use some process to share the effect of potential loss.   
    3.1. For example, to create a corporation to receive a pool of investors, in a way that in case of loss it is share with the whole group.   
    3.2. Another example could be to create a alternative line of product in face of some reduction in the demand.
4. **Transfering risk**: again, this is a kind of action that serves to mitigate a loss by transferering it or part of it to another part or section.   
    4.1. One common example could be to contract some kind of insurance.
5. **Risk acceptance and retention**: these are the accepted risks with which a organization has to live up to.

#### Benefits of Risk Management

The site [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/risk-management.htm) says that creating risk management in a organization is a very costly endevour, because it implies the recruitment of many skilled professionals to really ensure that the risks inherent in the business are mitigated.

But, on the other hand, the benefits derived from implanting a risk management, specially in larger companies, far outweighs the costs:

1. **Forecasts probable issues**: a risk management effort in the organization helps to make the operation more robust, preparing itself to most of the know risks, and even to be more ready to responds to other eventual or accidental risks.   
    1.1. Helps to avoid or at least deal better with disruptions.    
    1.2. Usually risk management brings a proactive culture of to the company.
2. **Avoiding the catastrophic events**: this one is a very important matter because eventhough risk managements helps to deal with a variaty of dangerous events in a good manner, there are these catastrophic events that should be known or at least have some turn around mechanism, since these kinds of risk can bring the company bankrupt.
3. **Enables growth**: while the main efforts in risk management comes to avoid bad occurences, in the process companies are forced to study their operation in detail, to assess the risks and to improve the whole process, what could certainly make the company fit to take new deals.
4. **Helps to stay competitive**: since the company would reduce critical losses and be more ready to tackle new endeavous.    
    1.1. And even in an event of crises the company would stay afloat and have a better disposition to act in the market during this time of crises.
5. **Enables better budgeting**: since the problem of resources are a major factor in risk management, at least in the operational field there should be a great effort to improve the budgeting.    
    5.1. And since operations could show a better and more transparent monetary picture, it should really help the central budget process to be more keen.



### Risk Management Standards and Frameworks

As it has been seem about risks, the process to engage in a risk management program is steep:

1. **Risk is a uncertainty event**
2. **Some risks are avoided, other controled, and some may be just wanted**
3. **That risk management is a multifaced process, depending both internally and externally from the organization**


So, not only industries, but also agencies and the government apply compliance rules and standards to help in creating a basic consensus about the problems and some possible steps to make.

And sometime methodologies and even complete frameworks are devised to give orientation to those participating in the risk management operations. And there are quite a lot of them:

1. **COSO ERM framework** 
2. **ISO 31000**
3. **British Standard (BS) 31100**
4. **Risk and Insurance Management Society's Risk Maturity Model (RMM)**
5. **The NIST risk management framework** [RMF](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf)


#### COSO ERM framework

Lauched in 2004, the COSO framework was updated in 2017 to address increasing complexity of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). So, i defines:

1. **key concepts and principles of ERM**
2. **A common ERM language**
3. **A Risk Management Guide**


There are also a set of 20 principles organized into five interrelated components:

1. **Governance and Culture**
2. **Strategy and Objective-setting**
3. **Performance**
4. **Review and Revision**
5. **Information, Communication and Reporting**



#### ISO 31000

Released in 2009 and revised in 2018, the ISO standard includes:

1. **A list of ERM principles**
2. **A Framework for risk management**


According Cobb new version is `shorter, clearer and more concise document that is easier to read`, and it also includes more strategic guidance on ERM that the previous and the necessity of covering the whole organization.



#### British Standard (BS) 31100

The current version of this risk management code of practice was issued in 2011, and it provides a process for implementing concepts described in ISO 31000.



#### The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

`The NIST risk management framework (RMF) provides a comprehensive, flexible, risk-based process that integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle through 7 steps`  [Bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/risk-management/)


The NIST risk management life cycle:

1. **prepare**: involving all levels of the organization.
2. **Categorize**: a catalog of resources, integrity, availability, etc.
3. **Select**: the design of the processes for risk management.
4. **Implement**: define controls for marking the processes of risk management.
5. **Assess**: analyse if the contrls defined as marks to the processes are being effective.
6. **Authorize**: define roles individual and responsabilities.
7. **Monitor**: the continous assessment of the operation.


And some of the roles existent:

1. **Risk Committee**: a subset of the organization's board whch oversight and approve issues related to the risk management framework.
2. **Risk Manager**: this role is responsible to coordinate the implementation of the enterprise risk maanagement framework, provide reports and can even be elevated to Chief Risk Officer.
3. **Risk Officer**: maintain the basic risk managent activities, including documentation, and report directly to the risk manager.
4. **Risk Owner**: this role is responsible to control and to monitor a process.
5. **Risk Actionee**: this role is acts the process.



#### The Risk and Insurance Management Society's Risk Maturity Model

The RMM framework is currently undergoing an update, but it readily available in the original 2006 version. It lists seven attributes of a risk management program and helps organizations assess each one on a scale from nonexistent to leadership level.
