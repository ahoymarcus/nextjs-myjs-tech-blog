### Risk Management

As a process, **risk management** is an effort to minimize or mitigate risks, as it starts with the identification and evaluation of risk followed by optiaml use of resources to monitor and minimize the same.


And now, as an general rule risk comes from uncertainty, and when he risk is assessed in the organizations the uncertainty is linked to the company's participation on the market place:

- **demand**
- **supply**
- **stock market**
- **projects**
- **accidents**
- **natural disasters**


And just as the risks can derive from a variaty of places, they also can be evaluated in two different ways:

1. The probability of occurence for certain risk scenario.
2. The amount of impact or damage it can cause.


#### Risk Management Life Cycle

So, summing up all that information, in term to optimize its own performance, the risk management process not only applies a life cycle to the process, as to have a continous assessment of the problem, but it also classify the possible actions depending on the significance of its impacts.

- **Risk Management Life Cycle**
1. **Assess**: identify potential risks.   
    1.1. The possible source for the risk.   
    1.2. The problem that may be caused by that specific risk.
2. **Evaluate**: define each risk according its potential impact.
3. **Manage**: the tasks and actions to deal with the problem.   
    3.1. Monitoring   
    3.2. Managing 
4. **Measure**: evaluate the results and restart the a new cycle.


#### Risk Management Priorities Assessment    

While dealing with risk management, it is important to assess first the understanding of the risks, because it's not only the concret risk at hand, but also some underlining features that will help to better classify its nature:

1. **Risk source**: what number and kind of elements come together to create the risk condition. And from where are they more like to come.   
    1.1. Perhaps each element may come from different origins and then come together to create some riks factor.
2. **Risk event**: this should be a catalog of potential occurences or changes, both internally or externally that could turn out as a risk event.
3. **Risk consequence**: to know also the potential outcome of some risks.  
    3.1. For instance, lost revenue, penalties from a regulator, disrupted operations, currupted data, etc.
4. **Risk likelihood**: to assess the probability of something happening, and document it as Low, Medium or High pattern.


| IMPACT     | ACTIONS                                                                                                                                                           |   
| ---------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |     
| significant  | Considerable management required | Must manage and monitor risks | Extensive management is essential |    
| moderate   | Risk are berable to certain extant      | Management effort worthwhile | Management effort required               |   
| minor         | Accept risks                                       | Accept but monitor Risks | Manage and monitor risks                           |     
| probability  | Low                                                   | Medium                             | High                                                            |  


#### Benefits of Risk Management

The site [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/risk-management.htm) says that creating risk management in a organization is a very costly endevour, because it implies the recruitment of many skilled professionals to really ensure that the risks inherent in the business are mitigated.

But, on the other hand, the benefits derived from implanting a risk management, specially in larger companies, far outweighs the costs:

1. **Forecasts probable issues**: a risk management effort in the organization helps to make the operation more robust, preparing itself to most of the know risks, and even to be more ready to responds to other eventual or accidental risks.   
    1.1. Helps to avoid or at least deal better with disruptions.    
    1.2. Usually risk management brings a proactive culture of to the company.
2. **Avoiding the catastrophic events**: this one is a very important matter because eventhough risk managements helps to deal with a variaty of dangerous events in a good manner, there are these catastrophic events that should be known or at least have some turn around mechanism, since these kinds of risk can bring the company bankrupt.
3. **Enables growth**: while the main efforts in risk management comes to avoid bad occurences, in the process companies are forced to study their operation in detail, to assess the risks and to improve the whole process, what could certainly make the company fit to take new deals.
4. **Helps to stay competitive**: since the company would reduce critical losses and be more ready to tackle new endeavous.    
    1.1. And even in an event of crises the company would stay afloat and have a better disposition to act in the market during this time of crises.
5. **Enables better budgeting**: since the problem of resources are a major factor in risk management, at least in the operational field there should be a great effort to improve the budgeting.    
    5.1. And since operations could show a better and more transparent monetary picture, it should really help the central budget process to be more keen.



#### Principles of Risk Management
    
Another interesting point on the introduction from [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/risk-management.htm) is the fact that there are risk management principles laid from many standards or framework, and the site then brings a set of principles taken from:

- **Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)**
- **ISO standards**

1. **Organizational Context**: this principle states that each organization has its own specifiies in their context that have to be accounted for risk management.   
    1. Exemples of context: the organization internal arrangement, local environment, organization culture, technological capacity, legal, etc.
2. **Involvement of Stakeholders**: they should be involved in the decision making, be aware of changes of policies, and even play some role when it could make sense for the operation.     
3. **Organizational Objectives**: while dealing with risks and uncertainty, the organization should always have the strategic objectives in mind and keep the big picture.
4. **Reporting**: that communication is a key factor in risk management, and a related consequence from this is the necessity to have also a process of authenticity of the information.    
    4.1. So, decision should be made on best available information, with transparency and visibility.
5. **Roles and Responsabilities**: that risk management has to be transparent and inclusive, and also take in account human factors, ensuring that each one knows its roles and responsabilities.
6. **Support Structure**: the support structure in the organization underlines the work of the risk management team/department, and should be able to ensure dynamic, diligent and responsive relation to the personel in charge of risk management.   
    6.1. Also, the people involved should be understand and be aware of their intervention at each stage of the risk management process.
7. **Early Warning Indicators**: there should a continous effort to process risk management, specially to deal with events at early stages, before a active problem should appear.   
    7.1. So, reliable communications at each level and engagement from the parties involved and each one of them knowing their part in the process.
8. **Review Cycle**: keep evaluating inputs at each step of the risk management process: **Identify**, **Assess**, **Respond**, and **Review**.   
    8.1. Analyse and identify reasonalbe interventions and remove unnecessary ones.
9. **Supportive Culture**: awareness and participation should help to motivate and bring people to participate more.
10. **Continual Improvement**: to be capabe of improving and enhancing the risk management strategies and tactics.   
    10.1. To use the learning experiences to access to imrprove the way the ongoing risk is focused and managed.
