### Introduction

According to the article from Jakob Nielsen, [Usability 101: Introduction to Usability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/), **Usability** is a quality attribute from software engineering to assesses `how easy user interfaces are to use`.

And then, it continues saying that the word **usability** can also be used to refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.

So, usability has in its definition 05 quality components that are implied:

1. **Learnability**: focuses on the easeness for the users to accomplish basic tasks from the first time they encounter some design.
2. **Efficiency**: it focuses on the practicability of some design, measuring the quickness for the user to perform a known task.
3. **Memorability**: this attribute focuses on the quention whether it is easy to the users to reestablish proficiency after some period away from interacting with the design.
4. **Errors**: this attribute focuses on anwsering questions about the amont and the kind of users errors related with some design (i.e. How many? Are they severe? etc.).
5. **Satifation**: this attributes focuses on measuring the state of pleasantness from the user with the desing.

Besides, those 05 usabilities attribute, there is the quality attribute of **Utility**, and this is another important quality issue, because it has to work parallel to **Usability** so a product can be seem as successful.

The relationship of **Usability** and **Utility** and how they are equally important in all this matter can be show by this two hypothetical arguments:

1. A design can be hypothetically easy and pleasent to use, but it does work the desired requirement. So, it is not successful design!
2. On the other hand, a interface can also work the desired effect wanted by the user, but in such a way that makes things hard or even impossible to the user to attain the desired result. So, also this is not a successful design!


`To study a design's utility, you can use the same user research methods that improve usability.`
[Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)


### The Importance of Usability

That in many software products, usability is a necessary condition for survival, meaning that websites difficult to use, or homepages that fails on clarity, informations that are hard to grasp, they all result in lost opportunities with the user.

And the same pattern repeats all around, just like in lost purchases in e-commercies, loss of employee productivity at the organization platform, etc. 

`Current best practices call for spending about 10% of a design project's budget on usability. On average, this will more than double a website's desired quality metrics (yielding an improvement score of 2.6) and slightly less than double an intranet's quality metrics. For software and physical products, the improvements are typically smaller — but still substantial — when you emphasize usability in the design process.`
[Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)


### How to Improve Usability

According to [Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/) article, there are many methods for studing usability, but for the author, the most basic and useful would be **User Testing**, which has 3 components:

1. Gathering of representative users from some system.
2. Testing how these users perform with the design.
3. Observation on what the users do, their accomplishments and also their failures with the design.


And the author also specifies some important points to be held by the user testing:
 
1. The representative users should work individually and solve problems on their own without any kind of interference from outside.
2. Most of time it might be more performatic to test for the most important problems and directing small iterative tests, then to run a hard and expensive study.
