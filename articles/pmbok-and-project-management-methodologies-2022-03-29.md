### Introduction
 
According to the site [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/) there over 8,462 project management methodologies around, but in its article it states some of the more popular ones:
 
So, in general terms a project management methodology is a set of principles and practices, that is a framework, that guide the organization of projects to ensure maximum performance. 
 
And some of the reasons the site gives for the great number of methodology highlight the fact that each project has its specific requirements and also its own context, and they should not be simplily handled down by a one-size-fits-all methodology.

Even more, that could be times when some set of principles and practices simply don't macht some kind of methodologies, and they should never be forced to fit into such direction.


But there should be some attributes or characteristics that could help to decide between one or another methodology:

- **Cost and Budget**: here, not only the amount, but also if there is flexibility to change it during the project course.
- **Team size**: in this case there should be analysed not only the quantity of professionals, but also characteristics about seniority level, leadership, etc.
-  **Ability to take risks**: some methodologies are more open to risks than others.
- **Flexibility**: in this case there is the analysis about the possibilities to changes in the direction during the project life cycle.
- **Timeline**: in this case there should be analysed how strict is the timeline, the possibilities of its increase or decrease, etc.
- **Cient/Stakeholder collaboration**: in this case it is view how much does the client need/wants to be involved in the process.

### Project Management Methodologies

#### Waterfall Methodology

This one is a traditional approach to project management, with phases that are complete linear, sequentially, and unidirectional. Also, each stage must be completed in order to progress ahead. It's stages:

1. **Requirements**
2. **Analysis**
3. **Design**
4. **Construction**
5. **Testing**
6. **Deploying & Maintenance**


Here, everything is planned and designed in the very beginning of the project, what can be somewhat very risk far ahead. And some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. A clearly defined and not changeble end goal.
2. The stakeholders know exactly what want and what will get.
3. The project is consistent and predictable.
4. There's need of extensive documentation for a regulated industry.
5. There might be some shift in the personel that needs to be absorved somewhat quickly.

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. The project is liable to change.
2. There is not a clear picture of all the requirements need at the beginning of the project.
3. There is a need to absorb in the project a continous testing or adaptations due feedbacks during the process. 


#### Agile Methodology

The agile project management methodology came from a need to implementing new kind of workflow to the traditional metodologies, specially in projects where the is the necessity to have adaptations to the final goal throughout the progress of the project.

In this case, the length linear flow was altered to a short iterational flow, where from each iterations there is possibility to tune and revise the process as it progresses. And this methodology finally derived also into a kind of philosophy inspiring many other sub-frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, Lean, etc.).

Some of its characteristics:

- **It's collaborative**
- **It's quick**
- **It's open to data-driven change**
- **Continous testing**

Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **The project is liable to change**
2. **The requirements are not very clear from the outset**
3. **Early deployments**
4. **The necessity to have stakeholders/clients more involved**
5. **There is a seasoned personal available**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is the need to extensive documentation, specially related to regulatory reasons**
2. **There is a very predictable deliverable, and it should be cristal clear from the start**
3. **There is no space for changes during its progression**
4. **There are no seasoned personel**
5. **There are strict deadlines or deliverables that need to be saguarded**


#### Scrum Methodology

This one is a form of agile management, and it could be thoght more as a framework than a methodology by itself, as [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/) says in their article, where some agile concepts are turn into:

1. **Short sprints**
2. **Requirements are iteratively processed into a Backlog**
3. **Teams have more flexibility, while they are held together by a Scrum Maser**


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **There is margin for continous improvement**
2. **There is a seasoned personel available**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There isn't  a seasoned personel available to hire**


#### Kanban Methodology

This is another method within the agile project system, originated from the manufacturing industry, and which is also more inlined as a framework than a methodoty itself.

There is here a great impulse to the use of visual tools to help to set and organize the process, and it also works with a system to refurnishes its Backlog to delegate the responsabilities.

Because of the visual imperative, it helps to monitor progress, to limit tasks between participants or to avoid bottlenecks.

Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **There is the need/possibility to use visual representation for the project's progress**
2. **A-glance status updates method**
3. **Facilitate to create focuses and limits to the participants**
4. **The progress is arranged into a continous 'pull' basis.

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There are too many complexities to the process to be clearly arranged into a visual representation**
2. **There is the need of a 'push' system, instead of the 'pull' one**


#### Scrumban Methodology

This one is another method from the agile system that has been devised by the merge of Scrum and Kanban, while being a hybrid agile project which benefits frorm:

- **The Scrum method to iterate the Backlog**
- **To make use of the iterative system of Scrum also to the planning, testing and feedbacks process**
- **To arrange visual focus and tasks limits from the visual representation of Kanban**

Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **It repeats some of the same constraints from the source methods**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **Here, also repeats the constraints from the 2 sources methodologies**


#### eXtreme Programming Methodology

Yet another form of agile system which emphasizes teamwork and collaboration across managers, customers, and developers, together with team's self-organizing.

Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **A seasoned team to be self-organized**
2. **A small team with personal with broad capacities and knowledge**
3. **The team can be arranged localy and in time zones to work into tight shifts**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **The team have less experienced personel**
2. **The personel lacks the broad capacities and knowledge**
3. **The team cannot work in a tight arrangement**


#### Adaptive Project Framework Methodology

Again, another methodology that springs from the agile system, and has its moto in adapting the project management due the inevitabilities of necessity.

And so, here, teams must try anticipate the risks and prepare for the unexpected in their project. They need to understand that key components are constantly in flux, and be able to constantly re-evaluate results an decisions with these moving parts in mind.


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **Again, a very seasoned team at hand**
2. **Possibility of clear and broad communication amont the team**
3. **Also, there is a lot of space for collaborative work**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **The project needs predictability**
2. **There is no resources to couple with the adaptability aspects of the process, including a senior personal**


#### Lean Methodology

Once again, another method from the agile system, and as Kanban, it also has it origins in manufacturing. And the concept of a lean method stands together with maximizing value and minimizing waste:


`While this originally referred to reducing physical waste in the manufacturing process, it now refers to other wasteful practices in the project management process. These are known as the 3Ms: muda, mura, and muri.` [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)


Here:

- **Muda**: this is the wastefulness that is the use of resource which doen't increase value.
- **Mura**: this is the unevenness that produce overproduction in one area and that finally will harm other areas, also causing waste and inefficience.
- **Muri**: this is the overburden because the great strain on resources.

Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **The capacity to continously bring improvement and add value for the customer**
2. **The necessity to decrease costs**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is a tight supply chain**
2. **There is also small capacity to absorve error**
3. **While this method aims to reduce costs, it is costly to implement**


#### Critical Path Methodology

The critical path method, also known as critical path analysis, where the core of the process is led by defining and scheduling the critical tasks, as well their dependencies. And lastly, the timeframe of the project will be determined by the longest sequence of critical tasks.

That means that you need to:

1. Identify all of the essential tasks you need to do to achieve your project goal
2. Estimate how much time each of those tasks will take (bearing in mind that certain tasks will need to be completed before others can be started)
3. Use all of that information to schedule the “critical path” you’ll need to take in order to get the project done as quickly as possible without missing any crucial steps.


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **The project is large-scale and complex**
2. **The project has a lot of dependencies**
3. **Through the definition of the critical tasks it is easier to visualize the core of the project**
4. **Better allocating resources, cutting superfluous dependencies**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is no need for adding too much complexity to the project**
2. **The deadlines, timings, and durations of the processes are not very clear**
3. **There should be margin for changes during the project duration**


#### Critical Chain Project Methodology

This methodology, Critical Chain Project Method is a upgrade from the Critical Path Method, where the critical paht has a very tight timeframe, with no room for errors, critical chain address the timeframe for the project with a more loose time span, allowing some space to unexpected events that may delays some things.


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **It brings much of the visual apparatus from the Critical Path Methodology, but with more safeguards**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **You have requirements yet not very clear, even with the use of the safeguards**


#### New Product Introduction Methodology

According to the site [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/), this is a great kind of project management methodology for introducing new products.

Also known as New Product Development, the New Product Introduction follows a single product through the entire development process, and which can involve multiple phases or a stage-gate process:

1. **Defining the product spec and project scope**
2. **Evaluating the feasibility**
3. **Developing the prototype**
4. **Validating the prototype via testing and analysis**
5. **Manufacturing the product on a larger scale**
6. **Evaluating the product's success in the market after launch**


`As the requirements for a successful new product introduction span a number of departments across an organization, from leadership to product managers to marketing and more, it requires a lot of cross-functional collaboration and communication.` [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **There is the need to bring a new or improved product to the market**
2. **There is the necessity to focus on a single product**
3. **There is the opportunity to bring key stakeholder and cross-functional alignment right from beginning**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is no need to allocate all the refered resources for the project that is devised ahead**
2. **There is the need for a more agile approach to the product development**


#### Package Enabled Reengineering Methodology

The Package Enabled Reengineering (PER) is a project management methodology that aims to help organizations to redisign products or processes with fresh eyes.


`It focuses on facilitating business transformations quickly and strategically, whether through redesign of processes or realignment of people.` [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **There is a need to overhaul the organization**
2. **There is the need to try fresh perspective on the products or processes**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is no need bring change or imrovement to the existing system**


#### Outcome Mapping Methodology

This is a project progress measurement system designed by the International Development Research centre (IDRC), which differs from the other projects because it does not focus on measurable deliverables, but on creating lating behavioural change. 

And the Outcome Mapping method consists of a length design phase followed by a record-keeping phase to track the results.


`It’s a common project management methodology used in charitable projects in developing countries. As a project management methodology, it’s less about the project itself than the long-term impact of the project and its ability to effect change in the community. As a result, it measures influence rather than other (perhaps more “typical”) measures of project progress.` [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **The aim of the project is to cause behaviour changes, rather than the deliverables themselves**
2. **The project is related to change and social transformation**: e.g. in the fields of international development, charity, communications, research, etc.

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **The project does not have the behavioural outcomes this method propel**


#### Six Sigma Methodology

`The Six Sigma is a method for improving processes with an emphasis on ensuring consistency in output and impeccable quality.` [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)


It also can adpt to incorporate some influences from other methodologies, like, 'Lean Six Sigma' and 'Agile Six Sigma', though it keeps its aim as a business methodology to eliminate defects and reduce variation in the deliveries.


This methodology can also be used for optimizing and improving existing processes or to create new ones, and as the above site also states, that the Six Sigma set of principles and techniques could sometimes even be aknowledged as a philosophy rather than a management methodology itself.


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **The aim is a set of principles and philosophies that could accompany almost any kind of project in the organization**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is not a lot of budget to invest in training and certifications**
2. **There is more need to define processes for particular projects rather than to set general guiding rules**


#### PMI's PMBOK Methodology

This one, as it has been seen before, it's not a project management methodology in itself, but rather a set of best practices, guide lines and standardizations, that can be used to ensure that projects across multiple types of teams and departments meet the PMI's high statndards and comply with best practices.


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **There is a Project Manager Professional (PMP) in the organization, or it wants to have one**
2. **There is the need to be up-to-date with industry standards and best practices**
3. **The organization is setteld where PMP is the standard project management qualification**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is the need t oa solid project management methodoloty to map the projects, rather than general (albeit helpful) project management knowledge**


#### PRINCE2 Methodology

PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled environments) is a project management methodology and certification that aims to equip project managers with knowledge of best practices and processes. [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)


And since it doesn't require as much prereqisites as the PMP certification, the PRINCE2 version should be a good choice for project managers looking to get both a methodological grounding and a qualification.


Also, unlike the PMP, the PRINCE2 is a methodology in itself. It's guided by 7 principles, which in turn dictate the seven processes a project anager needs to use in each project when using PRINCE2.


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **The professional is looking for a certification that can deliever an edge**
2. **The organization is setteld where PRINCE2 is the standard project management qualification**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is no need to the professional to commit to a full certification*
2. **The seven-step process doesn't map to the company's projects**


#### Rapid Application Development Methodology

The Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a type of agile project management methodology that aims to facilitate faster software development.


`It uses rapid prototype releases and iterations to gather feedbacks in a short period of time, and values that user feedback over strict planning and requirements recording.` [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)


Here, some other characteristics that would align with this methodology:

1. **The need of early deployments**
2. **The need to work close with stakeholders through prototypes**
3. **Speed is the essence**
4. **There's the possibility or the need to code reuse**

Now, impediments to absorb this methodology:

1. **There is no seasoned team available**
2. **There is no possibility of many interactions between clients or stakeholders as to create a viable commitiment to the project**
3. **The team is too big**
4. **There is the need of detailed spec to outlines all the functional and non-functional requirements**

### PMBOK

The Project Management Body of Knowledge is a guide for project management, developed by the Project Management Institute (PMI), and although the PMBOK may appear to bring a broad range of sujects, it may not be confused with a methodology, because in reality a standardizations and a best practice guide.


The PMBOK is not a methodology, because it stays in a more generic layer, which does not touch on specific traits like the many kinds of project, wheter it is construction, software, or other kind of project there is. It was first released in 1983, and recentrly in 2017 released its 6th edition.


And since this guide is internationally reconized (IEEE, ANSI), and PMI is largest not-for-profit organization for Project Management, PMBOK is largely used for professional software development projects.


`The PMBOK serves to promote and establish a common vocabulary for the project management profession by suggesting tools and techniques for each process and guiding in defining inputs and outputs as well. It describes the basic concepts of Project, Project Management, the role of Project Manager in different organizational structures, Project Management Phases, and the Project Lifecycle.` [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article)


These are some of the wide scope/constraints that the PMBOK works:

- **Scope**
- **Quality**
- **Schedule**
- **Budget**
- **Resources**
- **Risk**


#### Brief History of the PMBOK

Eventhough have been efforts to produce documents to support project management dating from **1981**, it was only in **1996** that in this First Edition a truly systematic document was launched.


There were an update in **2000** with the lauching of the Second Edition, but it was with the Third Edition in **2004** that the PMI institute had to organize and inaugurate a commitee to help in cataloging all the numerous participations soliciting changes. And it was in this 3rd edition that the guide increased generalize all kinds of projects.


The Fourth Edition in **2009** had it focus on acceessement, in a effort to make the document more consistent and accessible. And then in **2013** came the Fifth Edition, where the focus was especially in standardization of the terms, the processes, the inputs and the outputs.


Then, in **2017** came the Sixth Edition, which added new processes, but that kept special focus on the role and the compentencies for the Project Manager.



#### PMBOK Fifth Edition

According to the site [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article), the 5th edition introduced 'Stakeholder Management' as another of its knowledge areas.


And at this edition, the PMBOK guide interwinds 5 'process groups' with 10 'knowledge areas':

###### Process groups:
1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring and Controlling
5. Closing or finishing

###### Knowledge areas:
1. Project Integration Management
2. Project Scope Management
3. Project Time Management
4. Project Cost Management
5. Project Quality Management
6. Project Human Resource Management
7. Project Communications Management
8. Project Risk Management
9. Project Procurement Management
10. Project Stakeholder Management


#### PMBOK Sixth Edition

This newer edition included another features like **Agile (Adaptive PM)**, **3 new group processes**, **updated naming conventions**, **closing Procurement is closed**, **project Manager's role**.


###### Agile (Apaptive PM)

Still according to the site [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article), since Agile practices are a big part of nowdays projects, this same philosophy that was mentioned in the PMBOK 5th Ed, has been extensive been included in this later edition: 

- **Agile**
- **Scrum**
- **Kanban**
- **Lean**
- **XP**


###### New Group Processes

From the original 47 processes in the 5th edition, one was removed, and the bellow 3 were added:

- **Knowledge Management**
- **Risk Management**
- **Control Resources**


###### Project Manager's Role

Also according to the site [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article), considering the constantly changing role of the project manager and how leadership in project management is approached, this section now addresses PMI's Talent Triangle to encompass the **strategic**, **leadership**, and **technical** project management competencies and skills that a modern project manager should have.


#### The Concept of Project in the PMBOK

According to the site [ProjectBuilder.com](https://www.projectbuilder.com.br/blog/o-que-e-pmbok/), the PMBOK lays some guaidances on the form of a project, espcially in contrast to other tasks or operations, like ordinary processes, which can also to be found at the organizations:

1. **Defined timeline**: a project is a finite task that must have a start and a ending point limiting its life cycle.
2. **Exclusive objectives**: as a entity, a project also diferentiate itself by its objectives and goals.
3. **Limited resources**: since projects are not continous entities, but have finite time span and delimited objectives, it also must have limited resources related to it.


#### Advantages of PMBOK

Among many other benefits to the management of projects, its possible to underline:

1. **Standardization of terms and processes**
2. **Improvement in the flow of communication among the interested parties**
3. **More emphasis of the important tasks**
4. **Better usage of the resources**: including time.
5. **Improvement on the monitoring of the project stages**
6. **Better accessement of Risks**
7. **Better rates of project success**


#### The Agile Project Management and the PMBOK Guide

This very interesting section of the PMBOK Overview brings the article [Agile project management and the PMBOK® guide](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042), from 2008, where the PMI.org to try to understand the relation between this two important concepts of modern management: PMBOK and Agile methods.

So, alread at the beginning the article makes referece to this misconception into thinnking that the PMBOK 3rd Edition is more inlined with traditional software development, like the Waterfall Model, and should not be used with the Agile models.


Then, in its development, the article starts with a brief development of the PMI and the PMBOK, where from **1966** to **1983** a group of researches would contrbute with experiences and create some reports on project managemet and standards.

Then, only in **1996** a systematic document was published with as the First Edition of the Project Managment Body of Knowledge, which later would become a standard itself for good pratices in project management. Then the 2nd Edition in **2000** and the 3rd Edition in **2004**:


`Although the PMBOK® Guide does not dictate methodology, many software project managers nevertheless began to associate the waterfall model with the processes outlined in the PMBOK® Guide. Perhaps it was because waterfall was the prevalent methodology at the time, or perhaps it was because the waterfall model provided a framework that supported all of the PMBOK® Guide practices. Whatever the reason, it has been a hard misconception to shake, even though the third edition of the PMBOK® Guide makes it very clear that it is up to the reader to determine what processes are most appropriate to use in their situation.` [PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042)


And the authors from PMI.org really admit that in the 2000 edition, it was still difficult to see agile practices outilined in the PMBOK, but says that in the 2004 edition this points were alredy more clearly stated:

1. `There is no single best way to define an ideal project life cycle` (PMI, 2004, p. 20)
2. `the project manager, in collaboration with the project team, is always responsible for determining what processes are appropriate, and the appropriate degree of rigor for each process, for any given project`. (PMI, 2004, p.37)


And in the [PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042) site the authors also add many more instances, like articles and magazines, where the concepts were public stated.  


###### Project Life Cycle

The PMBOK 3rd Edition calls a projet life clycle as a `collection of generally sequential project phases`, there is a logical grouping of related activities that usually culminate in a deliverable.

And it continues that traditionally these phases were more clear to be understood as the ones seen in the Waterfall Model, but that this concret correlation ware never mandatory.

So, as the article progress, it states that the 'sequential' aspect of the timeline, specially with its required sign-offs, were seen more inlined with the Waterfall Model, but there is also a inherent sequentiality inside the Agile Model, more properly called 'Iteraction', and also the intermediary releases or deployments to the client with each iteration.


`This is the type of phrasing that might lead readers to believe that only a waterfall methodology is appropriate when following PMBOK® Guide practices. However if we interpret “hand-off” to mean that there is a hand-off of an increment of code to the customer to use as they see fit, then agile is still in keeping with the basic tenets of the PMBOK® Guide.`  [PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042) 


Finally, the author cleary contradict those that propose that each of the Agile iterations were a project by itself, saying that this concept, for them, really comes from those that are in fact putting the Waterfall model in the center of the argument by themselves:

`Because of this regular rhythm of incremental delivery, many have proffered that each iteration of an agile project is itself a project, having a start and stop date, and delivering a product as a result. I disagree with this assessment, however, believing it to be colored by years of waterfall practice.`[PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042) 


The authors even remide that the PMBOK clearly states that projects are `undertaken to crate a lasting outcome` (PMI, 2004, p.5), contrary to the idea that the sgin-offs should be accounted to each iteration was a project by itself, and not to the software development was a whole.

###### The Point Where there is a Clear Difference

And then, only in a singular point the authors reconigze that there are a clear difference of concepts between PMBOK and Agile pratices, and that is about **the participation of the stakeholders**.


So, for the Agile model, the stakeholders are called to have active involvement throughout the duration of the project, while in the `PMBOK Guide the view that stackeholder influence occurs up front and then declines throughout the rest of the project`. (PMI, 2004, p. 21)
