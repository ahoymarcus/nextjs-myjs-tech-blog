### Introduction

In this life cycle model, the software requirements are divided into smaller groups to be tackled in sequential cycles or iterations, where each iteration presents a version of the software until all the requirements are met and the whole system is finished.

Also interesting to note that the cycles or iterations should have a fixed period of time.

### Iterative Model phases

1. Requirement gathering and analysis: at this phase requerements are gathered from the customer and they are checked by a analyst to decide which of them are going to be in the particular iteration.
2. Design: here technical documents are created.
3. Implementation: here the requirements that were specified for the current iteration are implemented according to the technical documents descriptions.
4. Testing: here tests are set to check for the quality of the software. There are many kind of tests, but the most common are **white box**, **black box** and the **gray box**.
5. Deployment: the software is deployed to the user work's environment.
6. Review: in this phase the software is reviewed for quality and to be checked against the remainder of the project.
7. Maintenance: this phase is related to the assessment of the operation software to checks for bugs and performance.

### When to use the Iterative Model?

- When requirements are defined clearly and easy to understand.
- When the software application is large.
- When there is requirements changes throughout the development process.

### Advantages of the Iterative Mode

1. It's easy to understand, since it retains most of the scene of the linear Waterfall Model along with its iterations.
2. Together with the iterations, this model creates a "Feedback Path" along with the iterations that are valuable checks for the quality of the software.
3. It's easier to brings tests and debugging from the early stages of iterations.
4. It's flexible to accomodate changes in the requiremts.
5. Risks are easily identified and can be delt along the iterations.
6. Limited time spent on documentation and extra time on designing. 

### Disadvantages of the Iterative Mode

1. It is not suitable for smaller projects.
2. Demands more resources to be set.
3. Uncertainty with the actual requirements can lead to unnecessary changes at the design.
4. Requirement changes can lead to over budge.
5. System schedule can be lost along the continued changes of iterations.


### Differences between Agile Model and Iterative Model

It seems that the Agile Model is a more complex model and also have more features and frameworks than the Iterative Mode. And because of that the Iterative tends to be more rigid. And it also lack the abundance of frameworks the Agile has.

Thus, in the Incremental Model there is no overlapping of phases, there is no definitive mechanism for Risk Managing, there is less and limited interaction with the customer.
