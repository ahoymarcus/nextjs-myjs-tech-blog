### Introduction

A server is a computer designed to process and deliver data to others computers over a network, being web servers some of the most famous while they are responsible to process requests and deliver data across the Wilde World Web.

And, eventhough a server application software may be installed in most current machines, usually servers designate high end machines that are able to serve to a lot of clients.

`The server is the software that handles a specific task. However, the powerful hardware that supports this software is also called a server. This is because the server software that coordinates a network of hundreds or thousands of clients requires hardware that's more robust than computers for consumer use.` [Mitchell B.](https://www.lifewire.com/servers-in-computer-networking-817380)



### Comon Types of Servers

Just as a powerful machine can manage a server for multiple purposes, it is also common to have dedicated servers specialized  on singular functions. So, these are some types of servers that can be found:

1. **Web server**: a server that distribute web content for browsers, specially web pages.
2. **Email Server**: these servers manages the distribution of email messaging over a network.
3. **FTP server**: these servers use the File Transfer Protocol tools to manage files to its clients.
4. **Identity server**: these ones are servers dedicated to authorization and login purposes for its clients.
5. **DNS server**: these servers are responsible to store IP addressess and to service its clients translating the URLs passed to it into a stored IP address.
6. **Proxy server**: this servers concentrate traffict on network, serving as a additional layer between the architecture of client-server.
    6.1. When connections to a proxy server, it hides the IP address of the client from the other servers, which can only see the  proxy's address.
7. **DHCP server**: these servers are responsible for assigning IP Addresses using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
    7.1. The DHCP server found in the larger networks has its counterpart in the routers that are found at small networks.
