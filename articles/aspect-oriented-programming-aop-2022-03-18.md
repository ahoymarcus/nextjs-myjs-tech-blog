### Introduction
 
As a programming paradigm, AOP aims to reduces code clutter and improve maintainability and readability of the code by isolating concerns at the application.


It should be highlighted that AOP does not come to replace OOP, but to add and complement it by providing another way to the application to improve in modularity and also become cleaner. [Kanjilal, J.](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3040557/my-two-cents-on-aspect-oriented-programming.html)


Yet, another comparison can be made between OOP and AOP, because while OOP tries to achieve modularization through the use of **classes**, AOP aims the same results by using **aspects**.


And the way AOP works is to encapsulate common functionalities from the application, so they can be reused throughout the system reducing duplication of code.

This king of cross-cutting concerns that are create may include security management modules, notification modules, transactional modules, expception management modules, etc.


### Common Termilogies from AOP

- **Aspect**: it's a cross-cutting concern or a reusable module.
- **Introduction**: a feature that's used to declare additional methods and attributes for a particular type.
- **Join Point**: a point where one can plug plug an aspect in it.
- **Advice**: the action that is performed at a particular join point. It's also used to define the action that should be performed preceding or succeeding a method execution.
- **Weaving**: the act to provide solutions along for tangled codes along the application. Note that depending on the time the weaving happens, it can be in the compiled time, load-time or at run-time. [Kanjilal, J.](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3040557/my-two-cents-on-aspect-oriented-programming.html)
- **Target Object**: a target object may be defined as one hat is advised by one or more aspects in your application.
- **Pointcut**: it specifies the weaving rules, i.e., it is used to define the join point where a particular advice can be applied in your application.


### Advantages of Aspect Oriente Programming (AOP)

1. Reduced code clutter
2. Reduced code redundancy
3. Easier code maintainance
4. Fast development
5. Improved code readability


### Popular AOP framworks

- **PostSharp**
- **Spring framework**
- **Castle Windsor**
- **Microsoft Unity framework**
- **Police Injection Block**
