### Basic GitLab Installations and Features

There are two software distributions of GitLab:

1. **Community Edition (CE)**
2. **Enterprise Edition (EE)**


A typical install of GitLab is on GNU/Linux, but there is a growing number of deployments starting to use also the Kubernetes plataform. 

And some interesting features that it has are:

1. NGINX or Apache as default web server to proxy through **GitLab Workhorse** and into the **Puma** application server.
2. Server web pages and the GitLab API using **Puma** application server.
3. Uses Sidekiq as job queue which, in turn, uses Redis as a non-persistent database backend for job information, metadata, etc...
4. The GitLab application uses PostgreSQL for persistent database information. 

By default communication between Puma and Workhorse is via a Unix Domain Socket, but forward requests via TCP is also supported.


### Inatalled Linux Machine vs Kubernetes Container

- Official Linux packages can access files on the same file system with different services. Shared files are not an option for the application running on the Kubernetes platform.
- Official Linux packages by default have services that have access to the shared configuration and network. This is not the case for services running in Kubernetes, where services might be running in complete isolation, or only accessible through specific ports.

In other words, the shared state between services needs to be carefully considered when architecting new features and adding new components. Services that need to have access to the same files, need to be able to exchange information through the appropriate APIs. Whenever possible, this should not be done with files.

`Since components written with the API-first philosophy in mind are compatible with both methods, all new features and services must be written to consider Kubernetes compatibility first.`
