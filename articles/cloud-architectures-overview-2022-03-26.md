### Introduction
 
As a whole, the cloud architecture is the way how individual technologies are integrated to form virtual clouds, that is the IT environments which abstract, and group, scale, and share the resources available in some network to be used as platform for the execution of applications and services.


The cloud then is considered to be a Platform as a Service (PaaS), in which some provider delivers to the users its platform, together with all its underling infrastructur, to be used as a platform to boost the client IT needs of his business.


And there are some requirements for the creating of such enterprise that will be handled to the client:

1. Containerization
2. Orchestration
3. APIs
4. Routing
5. Security
6. Management
7. Software automation
8. online navigation UX


### Types of Cloud Architecture

The architecture of cloud can be **public**, **private**, **hybrid**, and **multicloud**:

1. **Public Cloud Architecture**: its an environment created without a speciffic user, but that can be allocated to many generic end users.
2. **Private Cloud Architecture**: its an environment create to be dedicated to a speciffic end user, which is thightly protected by firewall.
3. **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**: its a  combination of various environment which can be orchestrated and managed to handle various levels of workload.
4. **Multicloud Architecture**: this is a system which includes two or more clouds, may they be pubic or private, which can or cannot be connect to a net.



### Cloud Infrastructure Components

Here, there are two sides for the cloud environment, since there is the need for a front end capacity to serve as interface for the user, and a back-end capacity that will run and support the operation.

- **Data Center Hardware**: at the foundations of any cloud there is this infrastructure which responds at least to servers, storage, and networking, but that depending on the size of the cloud may also include many speciallized features, like accelarators, for example..
- **Virtualization Layer**: this is the layer which will absorb the fundamental infrastruture and abstract it to be mounted, orchestrated and menaged to create virtual machines to be rented to the client and which conforms all the normal capacities of a physical machine: computation, storage, networking, etc.
- **Applications and services Layer**: this layer has the support to respond to the front end client interfaces, and also is the layer that may offer general application to be used by the end client.
