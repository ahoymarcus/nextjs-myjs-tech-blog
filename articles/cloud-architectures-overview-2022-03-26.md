### Introduction
 
As a whole, the cloud architecture is the way how individual technologies are integrated to form virtual clouds, that is the IT environments which abstract, and group, scale, and share the resources available in some network to be used as platform for the execution of applications and services.


The cloud then is considered to be a Platform as a Service (PaaS), in which some provider delivers to the users its platform, together with all its underling infrastructur, to be used as a platform to boost the client IT needs of his business.


And some of the purpose from issuing a cloud service is to try to reduce or eliminate the reliance on on-premises server, storage, and networking infrastructure.


`Organizations adopting cloud architecture often shift IT resources to the public cloud, eliminating the need for on-premises servers and storage, and reducing the need for IT data center real estate, cooling, and power, and replacing them with a monthly IT expenditure.` [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/cloud-architecture.html) 



### The Cloud Architecture


#### Basic Components from Cloud Architecture

And there are some requirements for the creating of such enterprise that will be handled to the client:

1. **Containerization**
2. **Orchestration**
3. **APIs**
4. **Routing**
5. **Security**
6. **Management**
7. **Software automation**
8. **online navigation UX**


#### Types of Cloud Architecture

The architecture of cloud can be `public`, `private`, `hybrid`, and `multicloud`:

1. **Public Cloud Architecture**: its an environment created without a speciffic user, but that can be allocated to many generic end users.
2. **Private Cloud Architecture**: its an environment create to be dedicated to a speciffic end user, which is thightly protected by firewall.
3. **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**: its a  combination of various environment which can be orchestrated and managed to handle various levels of workload.
4. **Multicloud Architecture**: this is a system which includes two or more clouds, may they be pubic or private, which can or cannot be connect to a net.



#### Cloud Infrastructure Layers

Here, there are two sides for the cloud environment, since there is the need for a front end capacity to serve as interface for the user, and a back-end capacity that will run and support the operation.

- **Data Center Hardware**: at the foundations of any cloud there is this infrastructure which responds at least to servers, storage, and networking, but that depending on the size of the cloud may also include many speciallized features, like accelarators, for example..
- **Virtualization Layer**: this is the layer which will absorb the fundamental infrastruture and abstract it to be mounted, orchestrated and menaged to create virtual machines to be rented to the client and which conforms all the normal capacities of a physical machine: computation, storage, networking, etc.
- **Applications and services Layer**: this layer has the support to respond to the front end client interfaces, and also is the layer that may offer general application to be used by the end client.



### Types of Cloud Services

There are 3 major models of cloud services working to provide clients with IT resources:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: this is the simplest kind of service where the client rent machine capacity only that has the basic desired configuration, but has all the operation set by the client itself, including installment of applications.
2. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: in this model the client only rent the usage of software application and it is the least customizable model available.
3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: this is a kind of middle ground between the other two models, where provider offers not only the basic infrastructure, but offers also some stack, include middleware, of the operation.



### Cloud Architecture Best Practices

1. **Up-front planning**: it is necessary to have a clear understanding about the requerements of a organization, and how to correctly apply  its needs in the final design of the cloud.
2. **Security first**: protecting clouds from hackers and unauthorized users by safeguarding all layers within a cloud infrastructure with data encryption, patch management and rigid policies.
    2.1. Consider zero-trust security models for the highest levels of security acress the hybrid, multi-cloud enterprise.
3. **Ensure disaster recovery**: automate recovery processes to avoid costly downtime and ensure a speedy recovery from service disruptions.
    3.1. Monitoring capacity and using a redundant network can also ensure a highly available architecture.
4. **Maximize performance**: leverage and manage the right compute resources by continously monitoring business demands and technology needs.
5. **Cut costs**: take advantage of automated processes, managed service providers and utilization tracking to eliminate unnecessary cloud computing expenses.
