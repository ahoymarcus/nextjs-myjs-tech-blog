### Introduction

According to [JavaTPoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/devops) course, DevOps is `a culture to promote the deveolopment and operation process collectively`, and by itself, the name DevOps is a combination of two words, that is _Development_ and _Operations_.

A important matter about this culture is to shorten the gap between some essential areas of TI, just as software developers, quality assurance (QA) and system administrators. 

And it also allows the gathering of single teans that handle the entire application lifelycle, from development to testing, deployment and operations. 

Finally, `DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way.`
[JavaTPoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/devops)

So, nowdays this methodology of DevOps that brings development and operation closer has become a very important method in terms of the adoption the Agile pratices of system-oriented approach and countinous delivery.

And in terms of numbers, the [JavaTPoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/devops) article poits to:

1. 22% improvement in software quality
2. 17% improvement in application deployment frequency
3. 22% raise in customer satisfaction
4. 19% raise in revenue


### Why DevOps?

- The operation and development analysts are not working in complete isolation anymore.
- Also, the operation and development analysts are working in the same timelines and in synch.
- The creation of a system is no more entangled in the rigid cycle of production with separated and linear phases.
- With DevOps the members of the team spend a large percent of the time building the system.
- Also, manual code deployment leads to human errors in production.


### DevOps History

- In 2009, happended the first conference named DevOpsdays in Ghent, Belgium.
- In 2012, it was launched the report "The state of DevOps" by Alanna Brown.
- In 2014, it was published the annual State of DevOps.
- In 2015, it was founded the DevOps Research and Assignment (DORA).
- In 2017, it was published the article: "Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations".

### DevOps Architecture Features

Here, some key features from the DevOps architecture:

1. **Automation**: not only it can reduce the time consumption, especially during testing and deployments phase, but it also makes the finding of bugs easyer and the deployment a continous features. 
2. **Collaboration**: having Development and Operations teams working closer improves their timelines and synchrony, thus improving the productivity and making deployment faster.
3. **Integration**: working in a more integrated environment strengh the reliability of testing, since the tests are streatched to the deployed build, and it also bring more readiness to the development of new functionalities that can easily tested and deployed.
4. **Configuration Management**: this features brings assurance that the application will only interact with the resources that are concerned with its running environment. 


### Advantages of DevOps

- DevOps is an excellent approch for quick development and deployment of applications.
- It responds faster to the market changes to improve business growth.
- DevOps escalate business profit by decreasing software delivery time and transportation costs.
- DevOps clears the descriptive process, which gives clarity on product development and delivery.
- It improves customer experience and satisfaction.
- DevOps simplifies collaboration and places all tools in the cloud for customers to access.
- DevOps means collective responsability, which leads to better engagement and productivity.


### Disadvantages of DevOps

- DevOps professional or expert's developers are less available.
- Developing with DevOps is very expensive.
- Adopting new DevOps technology into the industries is hard to manage in short time.
- Lack of DevOps knowledge can be a problem in the continous integration of automation projects.


### Prerequisites for Technicians

To learn DevOps, it is necessary:

1. Basic knowledge of **Linux**.
2. Knowledge in at least on **Scripting Language**
