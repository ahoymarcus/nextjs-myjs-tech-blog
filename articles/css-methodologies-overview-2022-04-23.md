### Introduction
 
While CSS is a simple and intuitive language for styling web pages, but it can quickly become very cumbersome when a projetct's site starts to grow and to get more complex.

Some internal features from CSS itself can easily bring unintended changes to the project, just like its Cascade feature and also the feature where HTML elements inherit properties from their parents.

A CSS methodology brings then a set of guidelines and best practices to help the developer to achieve a more maintainable, scalable, reusable code. And some of these methodologies are:

1. **BEM (BLOCK, ELEMENT, MODIFIER)**
2. **OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS)**
3. **SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)**
4. **Atomic CSS**
5. **ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS)**
