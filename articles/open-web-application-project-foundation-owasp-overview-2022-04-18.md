### Introduction

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software, and servers as the base for developers and technologists to secure the web: 

- **Tools and Resources**
- **Community and Networking**
- **Education & Training**

### Some Projects Based at OWASP


At the [OWASP platform](https://owasp.org/) it is possible to find many projects that brings to the Internet Community access to security information. Among some of its projects it's possible to find:

1. [OWASP Security Knowledge Framework](https://owasp.org/www-project-security-knowledge-framework/)
2. [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/)
3. [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)



###### OWASP Security Knowledge Framework*

It's an open source web application that explains secure coding principles in multiple programming languages. The OWASP-SKF does this through manageable sortware development projects with checklists and labs to practice security verification.

Some of the OWASP-SKF:

1. **Projects**
2. **Code examples**
3. **Checklists**
4. **Labs**
5. **Knowledge base**
6. **User management**
7. **Design patterns**
8. **Support**



###### OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls.


`The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts.` [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/)


The CRS v3 tutorials:

2. [Including the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set](https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorial-7_including-modsecurity-core-rules/)
3. [Handling False Positives with the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set](https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorial-8_handling-false-positives-modsecurity-core-rule-set/)
4. [ModSecurity Handbook, 2nd edition](https://www.feistyduck.com/books/modsecurity-handbook/)



###### OWASP Web Security Testing Guide

The web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) Project produces the premier cybersecurity testing resource for web application developers and security professionals.


`The WSTG is a comprehensive guide to testing the security of web applications and web services. Created by the collaborative efforts of cybersecurity professionals and dedicated volunteers, the WSTG provides a framework of best practices used by penetration testers and organizations all over the world.` [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
