### Introduction

This model doesn't seem to follow the alignment of the classic Waterfall Model, in the Big Bang Model there is no specific phase related with the Requirements and its goals seems to be more loose or are directed by some pratical purpose. 

Here, the effort seems to be centered in the relation of **funds** and **inputs**.
