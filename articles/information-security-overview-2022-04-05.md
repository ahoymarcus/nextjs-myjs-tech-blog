### Introduction
 
The Internet today is really a world wide entity that as the site [SecureReading.com](https://securereading.com/infobasics-basic-concept-information-security/) states, the number of internet clients has crossed 3,4 billions by the year 2016, in more than 200 nations, from Arctic to Antarctica`.  


And with the worlwide presence of Internet, also comes the easy access to the information, which is more vulnerable than the ones tightly locked at headquarters, and also can be reached from any country in the world.
 
 
 
### Basic Information Security Concepts

The basic structure of information security has two primary focus:

1. **The Information**: the security of the related information, works focusing in a triad  concept known as CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)   
    1.1. Confidentiality: In brief it limits the access of information.   
    1.2. Integrity: it is the assurance that the information is trustworth and accurate.      
    1.3. Availability: that is the guarantee of reliable access to the information by authorized people.
2. **The Persons**: these are concepts related to the access of the clients who should be rightly interacting with the information.   
    2.1. Authentication   
    2.2. Authorization   
    2.3. Non-Repudiation



###### Note: another alternative model to the CIA Triad is the Parkerian hexad (Confidentiality, Possession or Control, Integrity, Authenticity, Availability and Utility).
    
    

###### Confidentiality
 
Information is a proprietary resource, and specially the **Sensitive information** has be kept from unwanted access. For example, finantial banking information, personal information, govern documents are information that must not be handled to the wrong clients.


###### Integrity
 
The information that is distributed digitally cannot have its contents changed during storage, transmission, and usage by unwanted parties, nor by human error.

The site [SecureReading.com](https://securereading.com/infobasics-basic-concept-information-security/) says that in some areas like financial data, air traffic control, and financial accounting, this concept strikes to be particularly important.

 
###### Availability
 
Also, the digital information has to be available by the rightful clients, meaning that not only it has be protected from data losses, but also be accessable for the parties that need to use the information.
 
One example of service where availability can be highlighted with particular importance is in service-oriented businesses, where the core of the business depends on the correct distribution of information to clients.
 
 

###### Authentication

This is the process that provides proof that some user is really the person he is claiming to be. Usually it applies some sort of digital identity, like passwords, smartcards, fingerprint, etc.


###### Authorization

But it is not sufficient to determ that some user is who he claims to be, because it is necessary also to restrict the correct activities the user can rightly carry out, whether it is to run a certain kind of program, to acess some specific area in a site or perform some kind of process to some information as updating it.


###### Non-Repudiation
 
Finally, another crucial process in other to guarantee a strong security to the information is to guarantee that the person authenticated cannot be later refused, that is to say that a user cannot deny his ownership to some activity performed. So, this is non-repudiation.

Segurança da informação. Conceitos de segurança da informação: classificação de informações, confidencialidade, integridade, disponibilidade, não repúdio, privacidade, controle de acesso, segurança física e lógica; 

identificação, autorização e autenticação.
