### Risk Management

As a process, **risk management** is an effort to minimize or mitigate risks, as it starts with the identification and evaluation of risk followed by optiaml use of resources to monitor and minimize the same.


And now, as an general rule risk comes from uncertainty, and when he risk is assessed in the organizations the uncertainty is linked to the company's participation on the market place:

- **demand**
- **supply**
- **stock market**
- **projects**
- **accidents**
- **natural disasters**


And just as the risks can derive from a variaty of places, they also can be evaluated in two different ways:

1. The probability of occurence for certain risk scenario.
2. The amount of impact or damage it can cause.


#### Risk Management Life Cycle Risk Management Assessment

So, summing up all that information, in term to optimize its own performance, the risk management process not only applies a life cycle to the process, as to have a continous assessment of the problem, but it also classify the possible actions depending on the significance of its impacts.

- **Risk Management Life Cycle**
1. **Assess**: identify potential risks.   
    1.1. The possible source for the risk.   
    1.2. The problem that may be caused by that specific risk.
2. **Evaluate**: define each risk according its potential impact.
3. **Manage**: the tasks and actions to deal with the problem.   
    3.1. Monitoring   
    3.2. Managing 
4. **Measure**: evaluate the results and restart the a new cycle.
