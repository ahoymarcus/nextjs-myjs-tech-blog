### Introduction

**Git** is a `version control system` used for:

- Handling the source code history of projects.
- Tracking changes made to files.
- Handling small and large projects with speed and efficiency.
- To collaborate with other developers on different projects.

**GitLab** is a public available service, based on the Git tool that functions as remote repository to codes and also offers many other features related with development. 

It was founded by Dmitriy Zaporozhets and Valery Sizov in 2011, under MIT licence, and it received a stabe version in 2018.

`GitLab is great way to manage git repositories on centralized server. GitLab gives you complete control over your repositories or projects and allows you to decide whether they are public or private for free.`
[TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/gitlab/gitlab_introduction.htm)


### GitLab Features

- Hosts your (private) software projects for free.
- It is a plataform for managing Git repositories.
- It offers free public and private repositories, issue-tracking and wikis.
- It is a user friendly web interface layer on to of Git, which increases the speed of working with Git.
- It provides its own Continous Integration CCI) system for managing the projects and provides user interface along with other features of GitLab.


### GitLab Wiki

The Wiki Pages at GitLab is a feature that gives the developer the opportunity to keep documentation inside one project, but not as the same repository as the code itself.

It supports Markdown, RDoc, AciiDoc, and Org...


### Basic GitLab Installations and Features

There are two software distributions of GitLab:

1. **Community Edition (CE)**
2. **Enterprise Edition (EE)**


A typical install of GitLab is on GNU/Linux, but there is a growing number of deployments starting to use also the Kubernetes plataform. 

And some interesting features that it has are:

1. NGINX or Apache as default web server to proxy through **GitLab Workhorse** and into the **Puma** application server.
2. Server web pages and the GitLab API using **Puma** application server.
3. Uses Sidekiq as job queue which, in turn, uses Redis as a non-persistent database backend for job information, metadata, etc...
4. The GitLab application uses PostgreSQL for persistent database information. 

By default communication between Puma and Workhorse is via a Unix Domain Socket, but forward requests via TCP is also supported.

### Inatalled Linux Machine vs Kubernetes Container

- Official Linux packages can access files on the same file system with different services. Shared files are not an option for the application running on the Kubernetes platform.
- Official Linux packages by default have services that have access to the shared configuration and network. This is not the case for services running in Kubernetes, where services might be running in complete isolation, or only accessible through specific ports.

In other words, the shared state between services needs to be carefully considered when architecting new features and adding new components. Services that need to have access to the same files, need to be able to exchange information through the appropriate APIs. Whenever possible, this should not be done with files.

`Since components written with the API-first philosophy in mind are compatible with both methods, all new features and services must be written to consider Kubernetes compatibility first.`

### GitLab CI/CD

GitLab  CI/CD is a tool built into GitLab for sortware development through the continous methodologies:

- **Continous Integration (CI)**
- **Continous Delivery (CD)**
- **Continous Deployment (CD)**

So, the Continous Integration works by pushing small changes to your application's codebase hosted in a Git repository, and, to every push, run a pipeline of scripts to build, test, and validate the code changes before merging them into the main branch.

The Continous Delivery and Deployment consist of a step further CI, deploying you application to production at every push to the default branch of the repository.


#### Continous Integration

With this tool set, each change submitted to an application, even to development branches, is built and tested automatically and continously.


#### Continous Delivery

This feature of the tool is a step further in the process of continous development, because here not only the application updated is built and tested each time, but the application is also deployed continously. **However, with continous delivery, you have to trigger the deployments manually**.


#### Continous Deployment

This last feature is yet another step into continous integration that makes also the deployment phase automatic, making unnecessary the manual deployment of the application.


#### Advantages of the GitLab CI/CD

- It's easy to learn, use and scale.
- It's free and as an open source software it is added in both GitLab Community Edition and the proprietary GitLab Enterprise Edition.
- You can execute the jobs faster by setting up your own runner (it is an application that processes the builds) with all dependencies which are pre-installed.


#### Workflow of the GitLab CI/CD

The commom workflow set for the GitLab CI/CD looks like:

1. Some code is pushed to the remote GitLab repository.
2. The pipeline is triggered with tests.
	2.1. Build and Test
	2.2. Preview the changes in a `Review App`, the same as you would see on your `localhost`.
3. Review of the updates made
4. Approval of the updates made
5. **Merge the feature branch into the default branch**
	5.1. GitLab CI/CD deploys your changes automatically to a produduction environment.
6. If anything goes wrong, **it's possible to reset the changes made**.

#### Configuring GitLab Runners

A GitLab runner is a build instance which is used to run the jobs over multiple machines and send the results to GitLab and which can be place on separate users, servers, and local machine. You can register the runner as **shared** or **specific** after installing it.

1. **Shared runners**: these runners are usevul for jobs multiple projects which have similar requirements. Instead of using multiple runners for many projects, you can use a single or a small number of Runners to handle multiple projects which will be easy to maintain and update.
2. **Specific runners**: these runners are useful to deploy a certain project, if jobs have certain requirements or specific demand for the projects. Specific runners use FIFO (First In First Out) process for organizing the data with first-come first -served basis. 
	2.1. And a specific runner can be registered by using a project registration token.


Especial cases:

1. **Loked runner**: a specif runner can be locked from beign used by other projects at its settings.
2. **Protected runner**: a specif runner can be set as protected, so it only runs on pipelines that are triggered or on protected branches.
3. **Untagged jobs**: setting this property at the runners configuration interface will determine whether this runner can or cannot take jobs without tags.
