### Introduction 

The RAD model is a linear sequential development process that emphasizes on concise cycles that was first proposed by IBM in 1980's.

Some characteristics from RAD according JavaTPoint:

- Gathering requirements using workshops or focus groups.
- Prototyping and early reiterative using of testing.
- The re-use of software components.
- Less formality in reviews and other team communications.

### RAD phases

1. Business modelling: gathering the information flow from the business model to enlight the functionality of the software.
2. Data modelling: translating the information collected into data models or schema so that it can be of great value to business model.
3. Process modelling: this phase aims the creation of a data flow that is necessary as the data be attain all its potential.
4. Application generation: the phase where application starts to be implemented; even with the use of automated tools, like the 4th GL techniques.
5. Testing & Turnover: since reuse is a import aspect from RAD, a overall reduction in testing time is expected, but new parts and all interfaces have to be thoroughly tested.

### When to use RAD Model?

- Systems that spam to be created in a short time (like 2-3 months), specially those that may gain with the use of modularization and re-use of parts.
- When requirements are well known.
- When the technical risk is limited.
- And it should be use only if the budget allows the use of automatic code generation tools.


### Advantages of RAD model

- This model is flexible for change.
- In this model, changes are ease to accomodate inside the short iteration phases.
- Each phase brings highest priority to the customer.]
- A reduction in development time.
- A increased in the reusability of features.

### Disadvantages of RAD model

- It requires a highly skilled team of developers.
- Not all application are compatible with it, specially those that cannot be modularized.
- It's not accessible for smaller projects, as the use of automated tools would make the budget unaccessible.
- It's not suitable to high technical risk projects.
- Requires user involvement throughout the life cycleS.
