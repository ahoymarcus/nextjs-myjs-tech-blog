### Introduction
 
According to the [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html) platform, RabbitMQ is a message-queueing software, which also may be called **message broker** or **queue menager**.
 
And in slimply terms, the CloudAMQP states that ReabbitMQ is a software that defines queues to which applications can connect in order to transfer messages. And that these messages could just be just a simple text message, or it could could be something more elaborated like some kind of metadata information to be used as a resource in another applications, etc.

The RabbitMQ software uses the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and you can read more about that in this article: `Advanced Mmessage Queuing Protocol`[¹]

### A Case Use Example 
 
From this use case presented at the CloudAMQP platform, one important point about the use of queues in applications can be seem from the flow of some asynchronous process, like a process where some application has to handle some information received, generate a document like a PDF, and then send a email, all these activities that may take several seconds and that would be better processed asynchronously, and this is why queues may be so effective.


`At the beginning of this article series, we had one producer (the website application) and one consumer (the PDF processing application). If the PDF processing application crashes, or if many PDF requests are coming at the same time, messages would continue to stack up in the queue until the consumer starts again. It would then process all the messages, one by one`. [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html)

### Advantages in the Use of Queues

- **Performance**: the use of a specialized component to handle special process on the fly for some application, instead of abruptaly creating short lived process to handle this specific tasks of messaging.
- **Layer Abstraction**: the use of a component to create an abstraction in the architecture of the application helps to insert interoperability to the system while reduces the coupling of the applications.


### Basic Architecture

The basic architecture of the RabbitMQ software divides the **broker** into two smaller components:

1. **Exchange**: this is the place/stage where the messages are published. From here the exchange becomes responsible to route the message to the correct queues.    
    1.1. While the Exchange handles this control, it uses routing keys and some properties to the messages to create bindings with the correct queues.
2. **Queues**: a queue is the name for a 'post box' or a internal storage  which lives inside the RabbitMQ server, and that it is the only place where messages can take part in the flow between the producer and the consumer.  
    2.1. Besides, a queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, and it's essentially a large message buffer.


#### Types of Exchanges

1. **Direct**: the message is routed to the queues whose binding key exactly matches the routing key of the message. For example, if the queue is bound to the exchange with the binding key `pdfprocess`, a message published to the exchange with a routing key `pdfprocess` is routed to that queue.
2. **Fanout**: this type of exchange routes messages to all of the queues bound to it.
3. **Topic**: this topic exchange does a wildcard match between the routing key an the rounting pattern specified in the binding.
4. **Headers**: the Headers Type of Exchange uses the message header attributes for routing.

#### [RabbitMQ and Server Concepts](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html)
- **Producer**: the process/application responsible to post data/messages that are to be consumed.
- **Consumer**: process/applications that rely on data/messages from other processes/applications.
- **Queue**: a buffer that stores the messages, and have to be bound to at least one exchange to receive the messages.
- **Message**: this is some kind of data/information which is shared by two or more processes/applications.
- **Connection**: which uses a TCP connection between the applications and the broker.
- **Channel**: this are virtual connections inside a connection, and all the publishing and consuming operations are done over a channel.
- **Exchange**: it receives the messages from producers and pushes them into queues they are binded depending on th rules defined by the exchange type.
- **Binding**: the link existent between the queue and the exchange.
- **Routing key**: this key is some metadata the exchanges looks at to decide how to route the message. It works like an address for the message.
- **AMQP**: this is the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol used by RabbitMQ for messaging.
- **Users**: it is possible to connect to RabbitMQ with a given username an password. Every user can be assigned permissions such as rights to read, write and configure privileges within the instance. Users can also be assigned permissions for specific virtual hosts.
- **Virtual Host (Vhost)**: provides a way to segragete applications using the same RabbitMQ instance. Different users can have different permissions to different vhost and queues and exchanges can be created, so they only exist in one vhost.


### Installing the RabbitMQ Server on Debian/Ubuntu

There are two options available for Debian and Ubutun users:

1. **Apt** framework on the repositiories from Cloudsmith.
2. **Apt** framework on a combination of repositories on PackageCloud.


`Both options will install a modern version of Erlang using Erlang apt repositories on Cloudsmith or Launchpad.` [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html)


First, the RabbitMQ server requires **Erlang** as a dependency:

Erlang is a functional, general-purpose, concurrent programming language and garbage-collected runtime environment supported and maintained by Ericsson OTP. [Computing for Geeks](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-latest-erlang-on-ubuntu-linux/)


###### First step: import Erlang GPG Key

Run the following commands to import Erlang repository GPG key:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https
wget -O- https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu/erlang_solutions.asc | sudo apt-key add -
``` 


###### Second step: Add Erlang Repository to Ubuntu

Once the key have been imported, add the repository to the Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04 system:

```
echo "deb https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu focal contrib" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/erlang.list
```


###### Third step: Install Erlang on Ubuntu

The last step is the installation itself of th Erlang in the Ubuntu system. First, update the system package list and then install it:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install erlang
```


###### Installing RabbitMQ server

For the most recent RabbitMQ releases its necessary to use the PackageCloud repository. So, first download and import the GPG key:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl wget gpg gnupg2
wget https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/gpgkey -O rabbitmq.gpgkey
cat rabbitmq.gpgkey|sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/rabbitmq-keyring.gpg
``` 

Then, adding the RabbitMQ repository:

```
echo "deb https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/ubuntu/ focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rabbitmq-server.list
``` 

Now, using the script bellow to configure the RabbitMQ repositories:

```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

Updating the system before installing the RabbitMQ Server on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt update
``` 

Finally, installing the rabbitmq-server package:

```
sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
```

And configuring the RabbitMQ service, here it's possible to check its status:

```
systemctl status rabbitmq-server.service
```

Now, enabling it if it is necessary:

```
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
``` 


### Hello World RabbitMQ and JavaScript

This is a simple [tutorial from the RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-javascript.html) platform that will be using the **amqp.node API** to write a simple producer, and a consumer to print out the message 'Hello World'.


This tutorial is using AMQP 0-g-1 and the Node-JS. And just bellow it is the installation of the **amqp.node client** library: 

```
npm install amqlib
```

The publisher/sender module:

**send.js**

```
#!/usr/bin/env node

var amqp = require('amqplib/callback_api');

amqp.connect('amqp://localhost', function(error0, connection) {
    if (error0)   throw error0;
    
    connection.createChannel(function(error1, channel) {
        if (error1) throw error1;

        var queue = 'hello';
        var msg = 'Hello World!';

        channel.assertQueue(queue, {
            durable: false
        });
        
        channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg));

        console.log(" [x] Sent %s", msg);
    });
    
    setTimeout(function() {
        connection.close();
        process.exit(0);
    }, 500);
});
``` 

###### Configuration Note: if sending does't work!

`If this is your first time using RabbitMQ and you don't see the "Sent" message then you may be left scratching your head wondering what could be wrong. Maybe the broker was started without enough free disk space (by default it needs at least 200 MB free) and is therefore refusing to accept messages. Check the broker logfile to confirm and reduce the limit if necessary.`

The [configuration file documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#config-items) will show how to set **disk_free_limit**.



Now, the consumer/receiving module. One interesting point here is that the server is going to deviver the message to this consumer asynchronouly, so the consumer is going to use a callback function:

**receive.js**

```
#!/usr/bin/env node

var amqp = require('amqplib/callback_api');

amqp.connect('amqp://localhost', function(error0, connection) {
    if (error0) throw error0;
    
    connection.createChannel(function(error1, channel) {
        if (error1) throw error1;

        var queue = 'hello';

        channel.assertQueue(queue, {
            durable: false
        });

        console.log(" [*] Waiting for messages in %s. To exit press CTRL+C", queue);

        channel.consume(queue, function(msg) {
            console.log(" [x] Received %s", msg.content.toString());
        }, {
            noAck: true
        });
    });
});
```
 
 
###### Notes:

1. see that in the consumer module above, the queue is declared also, because there's the possibility that the consumer may start before the publish, and it is necessary to have a queue prior to be consumed, otherwise an error should be throw!
2. The consumer will be continously running and it will be listening from the server. So, to stop the module it's possible to use **CTRL+C**.


#### RabbitMQ Team Disclaimer

`Please keep in mind that this and other tutorials are, well, tutorials. They demonstrate one new concept at a time and may intentionally oversimplify some things and leave out others. For example topics such as connection management, error handling, connection recovery, concurrency and metric collection are largely omitted for the sake of brevity. Such simplified code should not be considered production ready.` [Rabbitmq.com](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-javascript.html)



### RabbitMQ Server System Linux Ubuntu

Besides thoses actions used while installing and testing the RabbitMQ Server, to check if the server process is alive, use `systemctl`:

```
systemctl status rabbitmq-server.service
``` 

And here, we have how to check what queues RabbitMQ has and how many messages are in them:

```
sudo rabbitmqcrl list_queues
```
