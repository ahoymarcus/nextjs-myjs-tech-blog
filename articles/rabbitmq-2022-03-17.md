### Introduction
 
According to the [Cloudamqp](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html) platform, RabbitMQ is a message-queueing software, which also may be called **message broker** or **queue menager**.
 
And in slimply terms, the CloudAMQP states that ReabbitMQ is a software that defines queues to which applications can connect in order to transfer messages. And that these messages could just be just a simple text message, or it could could be something more elaborated like some kind of metadata information to be use as resource in other applications, etc.

The RabbitMQ software uses the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and you can read more about that in this `article` [¹]

### A Case Use Example 
 
From this use case presented at the CloudAMQP platform, one important point about the use of queues in applications can be seem from the flow of some asynchronous process, like a process where some application has to handle some information received, generate a document like a PDF, and then send a email, all these activities that may take several seconds, and this is why queues may be so effective.


`At the beginning of this article series, we had one producer (the website application) and one consumer (the PDF processing application). If the PDF processing application crashes, or if many PDF requests are coming at the same time, messages would continue to stack up in the queue until the consumer starts again. It would then process all the messages, one by one`. [Cloudamqp](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html)

### Advantages in the Use of Queues

- **Performance**: the use of a specialized component to handle special process on the fly for some application, instead of abruptaly creating short lived process to handle this specific tasks of messaging.
- **Layer Abstraction**: the use of a component to create an abstraction in the architecture of the application helps to insert interoperability to the system while reduces the coupling of the applications.


### Basic Architecture

The basic architecture of the RabbitMQ software divides the **broker** into two smaller components:

1. **Exchange**: this is the place/stage where the messages are published. From here the exchange becomes responsible to route the message to the correct queues.    
    1.1. While the Exchange handles this control, it uses routing keys and some properties to the messages to create bindings with the correct queues.
2. **Queues**: a buffer that stores the messages, and have to be bound to at least one exchange to receive the messages.


#### Types of Exchanges

1. **Direct**: the message is routed to the queues whose binding key exactly matches the routing key of the message. For example, if the queue is bound to the exchange with the binding key `pdfprocess`, a message published to the exchange with a routing key `pdfprocess`is routed to that queue.
2. **Fanout**: this type of exchange routes messages to all of the queues bound to it.
3. **Topic**: this topic exchange does a wildcard match between the routing key an the rounting pattern specified in the binding.
4. **Headers**: the headers type of exchange use the message header attributes for routing.

#### RabbitMQ and Server Concepts
- **Producer**
- **Consumer**
- **Queue**: a buffer that stores the messages, and have to be bound to at least one exchange to receive the messages.
- **Message**
- **Connection**: which uses a TCP connection between the applications and the broker.
- **Channel**: this are virtual connections inside a connecting, and all the publishing and consuming operations are done over a channel.
- **Exchange**: it receives the messages from producers and pushes them to queues they are binded depending on th rules defined by the exchange type.
- **Binding**: the link existent between the queue and the exchange.
- **Routing key**: this key is some metadata the exchanges looks at to decide how to route the message. It works like an address for the message.
- **AMQP**: this is the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol used by RabbitMQ for messaging.
- **Users**: it is possible to connect to RabbitMQ with a given username an password. EVery user can be assigned permissions such as rights to read, write and configure privileges within the instance. Users can also be assigned permissions for specific virtual hosts.
- **Virtual Host (Vhost)**: provides a way to segragete applications using the same RabbitMQ instance. Different users can have different permissions to different vhost ans queues and exchanges can be created, so they only exist in one vhost.
