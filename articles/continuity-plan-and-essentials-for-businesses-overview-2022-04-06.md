### Introduction

The concept behind a continuity business plan is the fact that unfortunate event cannot be averted all the time, even in sound organizations that have installed many standards and best pratices, or a risk management process.


So, eventhough all those processes are very important and help to make a more robust operation, there still have some processes that have be thought in the case of a concret disrupt event hapenning.


And these are the reason for devising a business continuity plan that will bring effort to keep the company running, at least in some capacity, that is for its essentials businesses.


`[...] within Business Continuity Management, organizations can defend themselves against, manage during, and resume quickly after a cyberattack, data breach, unplanned IT outage, interruption of utility supply, adverse weather, global economy shut down, among others.` [Bcm.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/business-contunity-management-bcm/)

### Business Continuity Management (BCM)

Business continuity management (BCM) is described as a foundation for the planning and preparation for sustaining a business operation or for rapidly restart its operation after some disruptive event.


And in that matter, methods are devised to promote and anticipate some specific disasters that may occur or to decrease the harmful effects of others unnamed harmful effects.


So, by used well-structured frameworks and tools, by applying standards, by making a sufficiently detailed documentation from the operation, the company should have more resiliense to support its operations when confronted by uncontrollable events.


Another interesting point that is brought by the site [Bcm.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/business-contunity-management-bcm/) is the fact there still today the idea of a Continuity Management Plan usually comes after other necessities from the organization like IT secuity, quality management, environmental management.

More than that, still according to the same site, for 3/4 of organizations, a continuity and recovery management is seem as `a second thought`, though many experts and studies may point that `75% of organizations without a BCM system in place fails in 3 years. [...] the likelihood of a business surviving hard times and bouncing back without a system in place is very low`. [Bcm.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/business-contunity-management-bcm/) 



#### Advantages of BCM

So, though a BCM measure may not be seem a essential of the business operation, specially when the tide is high, there are many direct advantages to have this system in place:

1. **Business failures that have a better chance of recovering**
2. **Dangerous emergencies that can mitigated**
3. **Incone and net worth loss that can be covered**
4. **Rapid recovery and responses to crises that can negatively impact or damage the brand**
5. **The ability to operate even during disruptive events or to spare some essenctial business activities to stay active**
6. **Increase customer loyalty and belief**


#### Disadvantages of BCM

1. **Its a time-consuming task**
2. **Poor BCM execution may led to financial losses for the company**
3. **The inequitaties in the usage of BCM across different economic sectors**
4. **There are different levels of pressures caused by crises in companies, specially in those that are less economically essential**


#### The Difference Between BCM Planning and BCM Frameworks

This one is a very important distinction, because eventhugh a BCM planning aims exactly all that needed during those disruptive events, it lacks 2 important attributes present in a BCM framework:

1. **All the path is already set**: the management does't have to devise and apply methods while the operations develop, specially if it is necessary to devise something during a crises.
2. **Its robustness**: the frameworks are develop in a continous mode and they are also put to the test in many different operations with different contexts.



### Implementing BCM Framework 

This article here frames some steps necessaries to effectively implementing a BCM framework:

1. **Strategy and Policies**: the process of continuity management is just a random response to some kind of event, whether natural, or economic, or political, etc. There is the need to have a clear and concise assessment of the organization, starting from its strategies.   
    1.1. Business strategy   
    1.2. Key stakeholders   
    1.3. Organization culture    
    1.4. Regulatory rules   
    1.5. Risk Police: risks catalogue and its levels of severity   
2. **Impact Analysis**: after having a clear picture of the organization and from some of the potential risks, it is necessary to make the analysis to understand how each part of the organization can cope with resources, risks, and recovery  of the operations.   
    2.1. Determine what kind of risks and the damage each part of the operation are more likely to suffer.   
    2.2. Resources necessary for each of them deal with the disruption.   
    2.3. The timeline for recovering the systems at each case.
3. **Budget**: for each of the highlighted areas in the planification and according to their own priority, it's necessary to spare the necessary funds for their recovery and continuity.
4. **Recovery**: this is the actual set of recovery plans with tasks and processes that are put in order to deal with everything that was previously assessed.   
    4.1. One important point present in most articles about this theme is the importance to have the a clear and direct planification, and not any set of generic  points or polices at this point.   
    4.2. Check lists: the use of check lists could be a interesting tool that could bring some visual elements to the plans and to highlight the nature of urgency for the tasks and processes.
5. **Tranning and Monitoring**
6. **Perform Drills**: this is imprtant to test in action some of the results from the plans adopted.
7. **Metrics related to the Continuity Plan**: it's also necessary to measure and compare the risks before and after the arrangements.    
    7.1. So, testing and validating make the necessary adjustments to use resources where they are really needed.
8. **Continous Improvement**: it's necessary to have a real picture from all the framework, to change where it is need, to update to new contexts and also to improve what as already working.


#### Types of Business Continuity Management (BCM)

From the Business Continuity Management (BCM) point of view, it is possible to have implemented specialized frameworks to work in certain specific circunstances:

1. **Crisis Management Plan**: this version stablishes a plan for critical communications networks, like for workplace security, data, etc.
2. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: this version aims for the recovery of crucial business processes, like information technology.
3. **Business Resumption Plan**: theses are the kind of plans which aims individual features of the company to be recovered and put back in action.



### Essentials for Businesses

Just as it is impossible to eleminate 100% from risks the organizations are susceptible, during an event of disruption it should be nearly impossible to give all the resources need to all of the companies areas and markets.


Because of this concrete need to concentrate the focus and the resources available, it should easier to priviledge some specific points or areas from the organization and try to maintain their operations, increasing the processes chances of success. 


So, while facing this dilema, instead of choosing tasks randomly, it should be better to specify **essential services** from the organization, that is all those services that:

1. **Have impact on the health and safety of individuals**
2. **Services that are related to the company's business strategy plans**
3. **Regulatory services**
4. **And other services that are responsible for maintaining and repairing equipaments and systems**


And then make a proper catalogue of these services:

- **Priority A**: essentials services or functions.
- **Priority B**: services that can be suspended for a short period of time.
- **Priority C**: services that can be suspended for an extended period of time.
