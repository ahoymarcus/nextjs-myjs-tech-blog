### Introduction

The concept behind a continuity business plan is the fact that unfortunate event cannot be averted all the time, even in sound organizations that have installed many standards and best pratices, or a risk management process.


So, eventhough all those processes are very important and help to make a more robust operation, there still have some processes that have be thought in the case of a concret disrupt event hapenning.


And these are the reason for devising a business continuity plan that will bring effort to keep the company running, at least in some capacity, that is for its essentials businesses.


`[...] within Business Continuity Management, organizations can defend themselves against, manage during, and resume quickly after a cyberattack, data breach, unplanned IT outage, interruption of utility supply, adverse weather, global economy shut down, among others.` [Bcm.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/business-contunity-management-bcm/)

### Business Continuity Management (BCM)

Business continuity management (BCM) is described as a foundation for the planning and preparation for sustaining a business operation or for rapidly restart its operation after some disruptive event.


And in that matter, methods are devised to promote and anticipate some specific disasters that may occur or to decrease the harmful effects of others unnamed harmful effects.


So, by used well-structured frameworks and tools, by applying standards, by making a sufficiently detailed documentation from the operation, the company should have more resiliense to support its operations when confronted by uncontrollable events.


Another interesting point that is brought by the site [Bcm.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/business-contunity-management-bcm/) is the fact there still today the idea of a Continuity Management Plan usually comes after other necessities from the organization like IT secuity, quality management, environmental management.

More than that, still according to the same site, for 3/4 of organizations, a continuity and recovery management is seem as `a second thought`, though many experts and studies may point that `75% of organizations without a BCM system in place fails in 3 years. [...] the likelihood of a business surviving hard times and bouncing back without a system in place is very low`. [Bcm.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/business-contunity-management-bcm/) 



#### Advantages of BCM

So, though a BCM measure may not be seem a essential of the business operation, specially when the tide is high, there are many direct advantages to have this system in place:

1. **Business failures that have a better chance of recovering**
2. **Dangerous emergencies that can mitigated**
3. **Incone and net worth loss that can be covered**
4. **Rapid recovery and responses to crises that can negatively impact or damage the brand**
5. **The ability to operate even during disruptive events or to spare some essenctial business activities to stay active**
6. **Increase customer loyalty and belief**


#### Disadvantages of BCM

1. **Its a time-consuming task**
2. **Poor BCM execution may led to financial losses for the company**
3. **The inequitaties in the usage of BCM across different economic sectors**
4. **There are different levels of pressures caused by crises in companies, specially in those that are less economically essential**


#### The Difference Between BCM Planning and BCM Frameworks

This one is a very important distinction, because eventhugh a BCM planning aims exactly all that needed during those disruptive events, it lacks 2 important attributes present in a BCM framework:

1. **All the path is already set**: the management does't have to devise and apply methods while the operations develop, specially if it is necessary to devise something during a crises.
2. **Its robustness**: the frameworks are develop in a continous mode and they are also put to the test in many different operations with different contexts.
