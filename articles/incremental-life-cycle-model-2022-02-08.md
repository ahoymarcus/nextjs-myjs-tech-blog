### Introduction

The Incremental Model is a method to engineer software that breaks or divide the requirements for a complex product into multiple modules or cycles that are progressively built adding complexit to the system until it reaches its final form.

### Incremental Model phases

1. Requirement analysis: this is a very import phase in the Incemental Model for its aim to identify the systems requirements.
2. Design & Development: this phase aims the desing of the system functionality.
3. Testing: its a phase for testing the reliability of the system and its parts.
4. Implementation: at this phase the current build of the software is put in operation and receives a increment in its versioning number.


### Types of Incremental Model

1. Staged Deliverd Model: construction of only one part of the project at a time.
2. Parallel Development Model: if resources are available, it can reduce the calendar time through the development of more than one subsystem at the same time.


### When we use the Incremental Model?

- When the requirements are complex.
- A project has a length schedule or the funding has to be divided by a length schedule.
- Implementation of New Technologies: error reduction in the system that is divided in smaller parts and tested toroughly along the incremental cycles.
- When the software team is not formed by a very skilled or trainned engineers.
- When the customer demands a quick release of the project.
- When it is possible to focus into a smaller set of primary requirements.

### Advantages of Incremental Model

- Errors are easy to be reconized.
- Easier to test and debug.
- Its flexible.
- Simple touch in handling risks along the many iterations.
- The client can get important parts of the system early.

### Disadvantages of Incremental Model

- Requires good planning and design.
- Total cost is not lower in its entirety.
- Well defined module interfaces are needed.
