### Introduction

According to the plataform JavaTPoint, software engineering `is the application of scientific and practical knowledge to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve frameworks, process, etc.`. 

And the site Guru99 presents a software crises of the 1960s, when many projects were deemed to fail because its excessive costs, its complexities, its mantainability, the difficulty to scale, etc...

So, in response to this crise, through the 1970s till 1990s, emerged a widespread use of Principles, Patterns, Guidances and Management Standards.

### Why is Software Engineering required?

According to JavaTPoint:

- To manage Large software
- For more Scalability
- For Cost Management
- To versioning of the software
- For better quality Management

So, in this day and age, software commonly grow in size, and also commonly has to be updated to perform new tasks, and a better management is the key for a successful software enterprise.
