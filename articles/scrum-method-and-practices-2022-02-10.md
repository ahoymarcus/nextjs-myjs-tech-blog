### Introduction

As it is stated at Scrum.org:

`Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps peoples, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.`

At it basis, this frameworks requires a **Scrum Master** to prepare the environment where:

1. A **Product Owner** orders the work for a complex problem into a **Product Backlog**.
2. The **Scrum Team** turns a selection of the work into an increment of value during a **Sprint**.
3. The **Scrum Team** and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for next **Sprint**.
4. Repeat...

As it is stated in Scrum.org, this framework is not a methodology, but the result of applying **the scientific method of empiricism**!

In a more simple explanation for the assessment these terms could imply that the aim of Scrum is to help development, and it is guided in an empirical manner, while it "provide means" for teams to establish and works hypothesis at their best effort and reflect this same experience to make the proper adjustments.

### The Basic Roles

1. **Scrum Team**
2. **Scrum Master**
3. **Product Owner**

#### The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team is a set of people, and it is **Self-Organized** and **Cross-Functional** as a whole, meaning that the people who make the core of the team are as a unity, self-reliant and self-sufficient in their role, without the need for external help for guidance or to accomplish their goals.

In term of size, a team is ussualy set with 3 to 9 members, where there are the Scrum Master and Product Owner roles, besides the rest of the team core.

### The Scrum Master

The scrum master have the duty to facilitate/coach the day to day development of activies, while he is also responsible to ensure that the whole team are in synchrony with th Scrum Values and Principles.

`Apart from educating and training the team members regarding the importance of Agile, he is also responsible to make sure that the team feels motivated and strengthen at all times. He also works on boosting up the communication and collaboration amongst the team members.`

#### Roles and Responsabilities of the Scrum Master

1. To coach: an Agile coach for the team and for the Product Owner.
2. Facilitator: he helps and facilitates with all the Scrum Events and also in making important decisions through coaching and guiding.
3. Removing impediments: any thing that is impacting negatively the team's productive or is a impediment for a individual member of the team can be resolved with the help of the scrum master.
4. Interference gatekeeper: the scrum master also safeguards the team from unnecessary external interference and also helps to prevents irrelevant discussions.
5. Servent Leader: as the scrum master is also refered, because he concerns to make sure that the members can have their obstacles addressed.
6. Process improver: in this sense, the scrum master is not responsible to get the work done, but to enable better processes, so the team can complete their sprint goals.

### The Product Owner

The product owner is supposed to be the voice of the customer/statkeholders among the team, and in this way to shorten the gap between those he represents and the team.

#### Roles and Responsabilities of the Product Owner

1. Bridging the gap: to work close with the external stakeholders to gather inputs and requirements to be placed at the **Backlog** and to collaborate with the team in a daily basis providing feedback.
2. Manages the Product Backlog: as he clarifies the inputs and requirements and orders them and prioritize in the Backlog so the team can achieve the desired values.
3. Certifying a product: he is also responsible to "certify" the features being built, defining the Acceptance Criteria for each of the items in the Product Backlog.
	3.1. The Acceptance Tests can be made by him directly or by means of experts assistance.
	3.2. And this activity should be done throughout the sprint, so mistakes can be found at reasonable time to be correct inside the same sprint.
4. Participation: he participates beside the team in clarifying the backlog items, but he also participas on the Product Release activities.

#### Proxy Product Owner

This is the person enrolled by the Product Owner himself who can take over al his responsabilities and to make decisions in his absence.

### The Development Team

The development team is the core of works that should make the delivere of the items, and even though the developer team tends to be a diverse group of specialized analysts, inside the team they can only be referred as Developers:

`The Development Team may consist of people having specialized skills like Front-end Developers, Backend Developers, Dev-Ops, QA Experts, Business Analyst, DBA etc., but they are all referred to as Developers; No other titles are allowed. The Development Team cannot even have sub-teams within it like the testing team, requirement specification team etc.`  
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

Finally, as a whole the developer team have to work in a self-sufficient and cross-functional manner, to to manage the work on their own, it is solely their decision to add/remove a Team Member, since it is up to them to build the necessary expertises within the developer team.

#### Roles and Responsabilities of the Developer Team

1. Development and delivery: it is the respose of the developer team to realease the item or items specified for the sprint at the critirea set by the product owner.
2. Tasking and providing estimations: it is also their response to gather the items in the backlog and brakes them into smaller job processes and them to estimate their times to account for the sprint timeframe.

`Nobody tells the Development Team what and how to do things. It is the Development Team’s responsibility to pick up the items from the Product Backlog that can be delivered in the next Sprint. Once the Sprint is started, the items cannot be changed/added/removed.`

### Development Team Size

It is a important process to decide the correct number of members at the developer team, because it should not be to big as to demand a expensive coordination among the team group, but it cannot be too small to hinder the group to possess the necessary skills required to deliver an increment.

The developer team should have between 3-9 members, and unless Scrum Master and Product Owner are themselves developers that will help with de production of the software, they are not acounted as part of the developer team.
