### Introduction

As it is stated at Scrum.org:

`Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps peoples, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.`

At it basis, this frameworks requires a **Scrum Master** to prepare the environment where:

1. A **Product Owner** orders the work for a complex problem into a **Product Backlog**.
2. The **Scrum Team** turns a selection of the work into an increment of value during a **Sprint**.
3. The **Scrum Team** and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for next **Sprint**.
4. Repeat...

As it is stated in Scrum.org, this framework is not a methodology, but the result of applying **the scientific method of empiricism**!

![scrumorg-scrum-framework-3000](/images/articles/development/scrumorg-scrum-framework-3000.png)

In a more simple explanation for the assessment these terms could imply that the aim of Scrum is to help development, and it is guided in an empirical manner, while it "provide means" for teams to establish and works hypothesis at their best effort and reflect this same experience to make the proper adjustments.
[AgileAlliance.org](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum)

### The Basic Roles

1. **Scrum Team**
2. **Scrum Master**
3. **Product Owner**

#### The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team is a set of people, and it is **Self-Organized** and **Cross-Functional** as a whole, meaning that the people who make the core of the team are as a unity, self-reliant and self-sufficient in their role, without the need for external help for guidance or to accomplish their goals.

In term of size, a team is ussualy set with 3 to 9 members, where there are the Scrum Master and Product Owner roles, besides the rest of the team core.

### The Scrum Master

The scrum master have the duty to facilitate/coach the day to day development of activies, while he is also responsible to ensure that the whole team are in synchrony with th Scrum Values and Principles.

`Apart from educating and training the team members regarding the importance of Agile, he is also responsible to make sure that the team feels motivated and strengthen at all times. He also works on boosting up the communication and collaboration amongst the team members.`
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

#### Roles and Responsabilities of the Scrum Master

1. To coach: an Agile coach for the team and for the Product Owner.
2. Facilitator: he helps and facilitates with all the Scrum Events and also in making important decisions through coaching and guiding.
3. Removing impediments: any thing that is impacting negatively the team's productive or is a impediment for a individual member of the team can be resolved with the help of the scrum master.
4. Interference gatekeeper: the scrum master also safeguards the team from unnecessary external interference and also helps to prevents irrelevant discussions.
5. Servent Leader: as the scrum master is also refered, because he concerns to make sure that the members can have their obstacles addressed.
6. Process improver: in this sense, the scrum master is not responsible to get the work done, but to enable better processes, so the team can complete their sprint goals.

### The Product Owner

The product owner is supposed to be the voice of the customer/statkeholders among the team, and in this way to shorten the gap between those he represents and the team.

#### Roles and Responsabilities of the Product Owner

1. Bridging the gap: to work close with the external stakeholders to gather inputs and requirements to be placed at the **Backlog** and to collaborate with the team in a daily basis providing feedback.
2. Manages the Product Backlog: as he clarifies the inputs and requirements and orders them and prioritize in the Backlog so the team can achieve the desired values.
3. Certifying a product: he is also responsible to "certify" the features being built, defining the Acceptance Criteria for each of the items in the Product Backlog.
	3.1. The Acceptance Tests can be made by him directly or by means of experts assistance.
	3.2. And this activity should be done throughout the sprint, so mistakes can be found at reasonable time to be correct inside the same sprint.
4. Participation: he participates beside the team in clarifying the backlog items, but he also participas on the Product Release activities.

#### Proxy Product Owner

This is the person enrolled by the Product Owner himself who can take over al his responsabilities and to make decisions in his absence.

### The Development Team

The development team is the core of works that should make the delivere of the items, and even though the developer team tends to be a diverse group of specialized analysts, inside the team they can only be referred as Developers:

`The Development Team may consist of people having specialized skills like Front-end Developers, Backend Developers, Dev-Ops, QA Experts, Business Analyst, DBA etc., but they are all referred to as Developers; No other titles are allowed. The Development Team cannot even have sub-teams within it like the testing team, requirement specification team etc.`  
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

Finally, as a whole the developer team have to work in a self-sufficient and cross-functional manner, to to manage the work on their own, it is solely their decision to add/remove a Team Member, since it is up to them to build the necessary expertises within the developer team.

#### Roles and Responsabilities of the Developer Team

1. Development and delivery: it is the respose of the developer team to realease the item or items specified for the sprint at the critirea set by the product owner.
2. Tasking and providing estimations: it is also their response to gather the items in the backlog and brakes them into smaller job processes and them to estimate their times to account for the sprint timeframe.

`Nobody tells the Development Team what and how to do things. It is the Development Team’s responsibility to pick up the items from the Product Backlog that can be delivered in the next Sprint. Once the Sprint is started, the items cannot be changed/added/removed.`
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

#### Development Team Size

It is a important process to decide the correct number of members at the developer team, because it should not be to big as to demand a expensive coordination among the team group, but it cannot be too small to hinder the group to possess the necessary skills required to deliver an increment.

The developer team should have between 3-9 members, and unless Scrum Master and Product Owner are themselves developers that will help with de production of the software, they are not acounted as part of the developer team.


### Scrum Artifacts

Thereare 3 kinds of scrum artifacts:

1. **Product Backlog**
2. **Sprint Backlog** 
3. **Product Increments**

![Scrum-Artifacts-types](/images/articles/development/Scrum-Artifacts-types.png)
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

#### Product Backlog

The produt backlog is the required items or requirements need to finish the project, and so it is the final document that the scrum team have to relate to in regard of the project.

As it was said prevously, its the responsability of the Product Owner and it is also his framework for explaning the requirements to the the team.

And in the article of [softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-artifacts/), it is stated that there is no fixed form about the backlog, thus there would be also no definition about the language to be used.

So, it could be technical language or it could even be on layman's language, and one example of a typical product backlog could be:

| Story | Estimate | Priority |        
| ----- | -------- | -------- |        
| I wnat to login | 4 | 1 |        
| I want to logout | 2 | 2 |        
| I want to change password | 1 | 3 |       
| I want to update address | 3 | 4 |       
| I want to add another phone | 1 | 5 |      

Some ideal rules related to the Product Backlog:

1. **It should be prioritized**: the items should be ordered in relation to their priority, and it could involve decisions like the benefit from the story point, the effort involved in the creation, the complexity, the risk or uncertainty, the customer priority, etc.
2. **It should be estimated**: the stories should always be estimed as per the agreed definition, and this could be used to help in the prioritizing process.
3. **It should be high level**: the stories should always be high level, and the creating of detailed user stories should be a task for the scrum team and not the PO.
4. **It should be dynamic**: it is expected that the backlog should update with the progress of the sprint, not only in terms of the evolving of more clear definitions for the items, but also for the addition, removal or modification of items in the story.
	4.1. Another natural feature to change or that could be updated is the priority of the items itself.


#### Sprint Backlog

Since the structure of the scrum involves small teams working in short iterations (2 to 4 weeks), the scrum team are responsible to identify the items in the Product Backlog to become part in the Spring Backlog.

Together with the responsability to choose from the product backlog the right functionalities, it is also the team responsability to estimate them and to decide `how much they can deliver` in that current sprint. 
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

Also, it is the sole responsability of the team to update the Sprint Backlog and to create more detailed user stories:

![Sprint-Backlog](/images/articles/development/Sprint-Backlog.png)
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

Some guidelines and best practices in creating a Sprint Backlog:

1. **Group decision**: the developer team should decide as a whole, since it is view as a cross-functional team itself.
2. **Don't assign tasks**: the developer team is in itself also self-sufficient, so it is also their sole responsability to pick items for themselves and decide among the group how to proceed.
3. **A definition of done**: there should be not only an agreement, but also a clear and visible description about the "shippable product".
4. **It should be dynamic**: just as the PO progress with the product backlog, the team should progress in relation to the items, tasks and definitions in the Sprint Backlog.
5. **It should be extensive**: in the meaning that the Sprint Backlog should contain everything that is needed to deliver a shippable product, even if the task do not related to some coding action.

#### Product Increments

The Product Increments is the aggregation of all the Sprint Backlogs items completed, and the summation toward the delivering of a final product.

`What this means is that whatever was the result of the sprint is an increment. Obviously, for the result to be considered an increment, it should first meet the pre-defined definition of done i.e. the end result should be a usable product which is capable of “shipping”.` 
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)


### Scrum Events

There is some different terminology used to these events, but they all should represent some event whose goal is the monitoring and accomplishing the Sprint work:

- Scrum ceremonies
- Scrum rituals
- Scrum meetings

#### Types of Scrum Events

The events are __in-person__ gathering organized by the Scrum Master, and it can be dedicated to some specific groups, including events with the stakeholders, or managers and even the custumer.

But each event should follow the stipulated time frame and focus at its specific objectives, and it is the responsability of the Scrum Master to state clearly all these points and to work with the event for its best results and without deviations.

The **Time Boxing**, though it cannot be extended, it can be shortened if the goals of the event have already been met.

Usually, the length of the event is proportional to the length of the current Sprint, except for the **Daily Standup** that has a fixed time box of 15 minutes.

**note**: only in exceptional cases, where it might be aggred upon by all the participants, a event could have its timebox extended.

#### The Sprint Planning Ceremonies

It is the initial ceremony when starting a Sprint and it has the Product Owner as the focused point as he brings the Product Backlog for presenting the user stories to the team, and its a ceremony where no one else but the team should participate.

**note**: eventhough it is the sole responsability of the PO to define the Backlog, the team is authorized to reject some user story that don't follow the necessary Acceptance Criteria defined.

Is purpose is to gather the team and clarify all the necessary points, and in that regard the team is allowed to ask as many questions necessary to have the story complete and sustanable.

After all the points in the story are decided, the group estimates each of the users stories and they pick up all those that should be accomplished in the Sprint according to their priorization.

About the **Velocity**, it `is determined by the total number of story points completed in an average sprint. The velocity is calculated based on the historical Sprints and by averaging them out. The more sprints we complete the more stable the velocity for a team is.`
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

There are many techniques, but a common one for Story Estimation would be the **Plannig Poker Cards**, where values are assigned following the Fibonacci Series, and when some story reaches 13 it is divided to be correctly fitted in a short sprint.

```
Fibonacci Series – 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on.
```

Eventhough the Sprint Planning goal is for deciding the Sprint Backlog and the shippiment criterea, it is possible that the team may start writing some initial tasks also.

Finally, there some specific items that could also become part of the Sprint Backlog:

- **Spikes**: a spike represents some research task needed in relation to the accomplishment of a user story.
- **Technical debts**: these are necessary refactoring that have to be done on the code already developed.
- **Bugs**: these are also issues that are relevant to be tackled by the team.


#### The Daily Standup Ceremony

The Daily Stanup ceremony is a meeting which brings the opportunity to illustrate the overall view of the Sprint's state. 

It's also a moment for the team to share the current jobs and to confirn whether may be something hindering the Sprint's goals.

Thus, in this event each team member is called to shares the status of his tasks and to share any hindrance and seek help in the case they are stalled in something.

Three ceremonial questions:

1. "What have you done since the last Daily Standup Meeting?"
2. "What do you plan to do today?"
3. "Is there any impediment blocking your work?"

`[...]members are expected to pay attention when someone is sharing the status and offer for help if the need arises. As soon as the last team member has answered all the three questions, the meeting ends there.`
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

At last, it is important to reminde the importance of the Scrum Master in leading this ceremony also:

- To focus on the 15 minutes time box. So, in some cases he can step into the discussions and ask the team members to continue some specific point of discussion offline.
- To control that only core team members are allowed to share their state, eventhough people interested on the Sprint's goal are allowed to attend the meeting.
- The Daily Standup should hapen even if there is only a single team member present.
- To retain the same time and location to reduce overhead of information.
- Discourages the use of notebooks, cel-phones, etc...
- To pass important news and updates if the time frame allows.

#### The Sprint Review Ceremony (or Sprint Demo)

This ceremony has the purpose to demonstrate the work done in the Sprint, and gather feedback and buy-in.

Usually, each demonstrations and the responses for the queries are done by the team member responsible for that same task.

Here, the Product Owner has a distinct job of evaluating the user story being demonstrated against acceptance criteria defined before hand.

Thus, a accepted store is shipped to the Product Increments artifact, and the rejected can be sent either back to the Product Backlog or to go direct to the next Sprint Backlog.

`Another key outcome of the Sprint Review meeting is that the team members learn a thing about estimation. The number of user stories accepted determines the number of story points achieved in a sprint. Thus gradually sprint by sprint, the team can develop the ability to estimate correctly and make an informed decision regarding the story points that are feasible to achieve.`
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

Finally, as always, the Scrum Master has the responsability to maintain the focus of the meeting at the time box and to welcome the attendees, that in this ceremony could be also stakeholders, managers, users, etc...

#### The Sprint Retrospective Ceremony

This ceremony is performed always at the very end of some Sprint and it gives the chance to bring reflections about the later Sprint whereabouts.

`Remember the objective of the meeting to take a step ahead in the area of improvisation and not to hold the team by increasing the tension amongst the members.
[Softwaretestinghelp.com](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/scrum-roles-responsibilities/)

Ànd the team is expected to answer a four part question about the later Sprint:

1. **What went well?**
2. **What have you learned?**
3. **What didin't go well?**
4. **What could be done better?**

**note**: the more fragile part of the question is the third one and come from the Scrum Master to help directing the conversatios so it might not derail, but be productive.

Finally, at this last ceremony of the Sprint iteration, there is the both the case of attendees and the outcome of the ceremony itself. In the first case, hboth the Scrum Master and the Product Owner take their turns beside the core team, and it is not allowed people outside to attend to it. And the second point is that as an outcome it may be expected a list of action items from it.

#### Backlog Refinement Ceremony

Finally, after the Sprint iteration is finished, the team meet to refine the Product Backlog as part of the recent growth the group experienced, preparing it for the beginning of the next Sprint.
