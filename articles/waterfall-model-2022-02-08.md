### Introduction

Introduced by Winston Royce in the 1970, this model has 05 phases:

1. Requirements Analysis and Specification
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Unit Testing
5. Integration and System Testing

Though this model is rarely used nowdays, `it is very important because all the other software development life cycle models are based on the classical waterfall model[...]This model considers that one phase can be started after completion of the previous phase. That is the output of one phase will be the input to the next phase. Thus the development process can be considered as a sequential flow in the waterfall.`

### Feasibility Study phase

This stage aims to determine the finantial and technical feasibility to develop the software.

### Requirements Analysis and Specification phase

It's the phase to understand the exact requirements stated by the costumer and to document them properly, so the developer works besides the client.

And this is the moment to describes the "What" of the system and not the "How", and it has to very distinctive activities, that is the Requirement Gathering and Analysis, and the Specification.

At the first activity the goal is to get and analyse requirements to remove incompleteness, while the second activity is to create the very detailed document Software Requirement Specification (SRS) which will contain all the detailed description of the system in plain and ordinaire language.  


### Design phase

In this phase there is the effort to translate the SRS to a technical document, and the Software Design Document (SDD) will define the orverall of the software in high level and detailed design sheets.


### Implementation and Unit Testing phase

Here, in this phase starts the implementation of the software, and according to the site JavaTPoint, if the SDD is complete, the implementation should be smooth, because it will contain all the information needed by the developers to complete the project.

And then, during test the code is thoroughly examined. The small modules are tested in isolation, and after the modules are tested `by writing some overhead code to check the interation between these modules and the flow of intermediate output`.

### Integration and System Testing phase

According to the site JavaTPoint, this is a `highly crucial` phase in terms of quality of the product, because of the effectiveness of the testing, that will not be in isolation anymore, but measuring the interactions with all the system as a whole.

The System Testing consists of three different kinds of tests:

1. Alpha testing: performed by the development team.
2. Beta testing: performed by a "friendly" set of customers.
3. Acceptance testing: performed by the customers to determine their acceptance or rejection of the product.

### Operation and Maintenance phase

This is the phase when the product is already operational and in use by the customer. And according to GeeksforGeeks.org, this is the most important phase in the software life cycle, where 60% of the effort is spent on by the developers.

And there are basically three types of maintenance:

1. Corrective Mainatenance: carried out to correct errors not seem yet.
2. Perfective Maintenance: carried out to enhance the functionalities of the system at a customer request.
3. Adaptative Maintenance: it is ussualy the king of work made to port the software to new environments.


### When to Use SDLC Waterfall Model?

Some circumstances where the Waterfall model is more suited:

- When the requirements are constant and not changed regularly.
- A short project. 
- The situation is tranquil. 
- Where the tools and technology used is consistent and is not changing.
- When resources are well prepared and available to use.

### Advantages of the Waterfall Model

- This model is simple and the resources to implement its use are fairly minimal.
- The requirements are tackled in a linear forward progression.
- Fixed Start and End point, making it easy to cover its progress.
- Both the release date, as the final cost of the product are more easily determined beforehand.
- It is easier and more transparent to the customer understanding of the project.

### Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model

- The risk factor is very high, because of some unseem error. Thus this model is not suitable to large and complex projects.
- This model cannot accept changes in requirements during development.
- And this model becomes very tough when it is necessary to revisite a past phase for any change in it.
- Since the bulk of the testing is done at a later stage, identifying challenges besides the risk are very difficult to prepare to.
