### Introduction

The use of measurements to qualify the software product and to attribute to this qualities patterns and processes of standardization.

The need of Software Measurement:

1. Define quality for the current product or process.
2. Anticipate future qualities for the current product or process.
3. Enhance the quality of a product or process.
4. Regulate the state of the project in relation to budget and schedule.


### Types of Software Measurement

There are 2 types of software measurements:

1. **Direct Measurement**: in direct measurement the product, process, or any other thing that is directly measured using some kind of standard scale.
2. **Indirect Measurement**: in direct measurement the quantity or quality to be measured is measured using related parameter, i.e. by use of reference.


### The Metrics

A metric is a measurement of the level that any impute belongs to a system product or process. There are 4 function related to software metrics:

1. Planning
2. Organizing
3. Controlling
4. Improving

#### Characteristics of Software Metrics

1. **Quantitative**: metrics must possess quantitative nature, that is, metrics should be able to be expressed in values.
2. **Understandable**: there should be some clear definition for its meaning.
3. **Applicability**: it should be applicable since the initial phases of development.
4. **Repeatable**: the metric should be consistent between repeatable measurements.
5. **Economical**: computation of metrics should be economical.
6. **Language independent**: a metric should not depend on any speciffic programming language.


#### Classification of Software Metrics

1. **Product metrics**: are used to describe and evaluate the state of the product itself.
2. **Process metrics**: are used to describe and evaluate the actions, the tasks, or the kinds of organizations that are implemented upon the product.
3. **Project metrics**: this should describe and evaluate the characteristics and execution of the project:      
	3.1. Number of sotware developers     
	3.2. Staffing pattern over the life cycle of sortware      
	3.3. Cost and schedule     
	3.4. Productivity
