### Introduction

UI and UX design are two important processes in software development, where:

1. **UI Design**: it stands to User Interface Design and it is related to deal with brand and visual styles and assets from the product.
2. **UX Design**: and this stands to User Experience Design, and it relates to the quality of interation between the user and the elements of the product and the services provided.


In the article from [Norman and Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/) about UX we learn that **User Experience** or **UX** is a process focused at the needs of the user, and that it goes beyond the mere requirements of proving the correct services to the user.

And perhaps here it is possible to divise a clear separantion of concerns between these two important process related to the product design. 

That is, while **UI** aims to design a interfce that meets all the system requirements and at the same time that should meet all the needed user requirements of Usability and Utility, that are processes related to the user and the quality of his interactions with the interface.

In that case, **Usability** and **Utility** are 
meant provide additional qualities to the interface, among others it could be said:

- **Easy to learn**
- **Efficient to use**
- **Pleasant**
- **Give the correct effect**
 
**Note**: about Usability and Utility, see also this article - _Usability Overview_[^1]
 

On the other hand, for a **UX** design to succeeded it should aim to extend the user experience of a service to its fullest. And it would imply that the service could extend the user enjoyment of ones product or brand.

In the article, Norman and Nielsen give a very interesting example of the difference in perspective of UX where in a Website with movie reviews, for example, even a perfect user interface design that could meets all the necessary quality attributes of UI needed, like easiness of interaction, correction of the service, but it could still lacks UX design of the product, because the lack of variaty in the topics provided or at the amount of information given to the user, and thus the UX design would still be underperforming in relation to the user experience.

`As an example, consider a website with movie reviews. Even if the UI for finding a film is perfect, the UX will be poor for a user who wants information about a small independent release if the underlying database only contains movies from the major studios.`
[Norman and Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/) 


Key differences according to the article from [Guru99.com](https://www.guru99.com/ui-vs-ux.html):

1. **UI design**: it is related to the interface and its relation to the interaction of the user with the product.   
2. **UX design**: it is related and focused with everything in the product that may affect the user commitment with a product.


### UI Design

According to the article from [Mark Nunes](https://medium.com/ui-lab-school/os-princ%C3%ADpios-do-design-em-user-interface-80f300cb81e0), the craft of Design has some basic properties, and with the correct balance in the use of these properties could result in a good design.


#### UI Basic Principles

The properties are:
1. **Axis**: this is a imaginary line that divides the body of the interface according to ratio, and weight, or moviment (like direction).
2. **Symmetry**: with this property it's possible to achieve the effect of balance or inbalance on the design, beign the first one related to the balance in the use of the visual elements, and the other in the use of some form of assymetry.
3. **Hierarchy**: this is a important property that can be used to define scope, for example, using Size and with it focal points.     
	3.1. Size   
	3.2. Form   
	3.3. Position
4. **Rhythm**: this property is related to pattern and repetition.     
	4.1. Pattern: it can be some king of grouping of elements that goes together throughout the design, like Title, Description and some Icon, for example.     
	4.2. Repetition: this attribute can define the flow of the recurring element or even some break in the flow and start of another, what could represent different contexts in the layout of the interface.


#### UI Designer Responsabilities

- The UI desiners needs to convert all the user requirements of the product into a captivating user interface.
- The UI designer must guide and instruct the visual journey of the user into the interface.
- The UI designer must provide all the necessary interactive elements nedd by the user.
- The UI designers must deal with al the psychological means related to the interface so it makes the interaction of the user more appealing and intuite.



### UX Design

Just it was said about the user interface design, there are a set properties and practices that instruct the work with UX Design.

Another point to be made is that this set of UX properties should also have it own purposes and context, as it has been seem in the introcution.

And as it was stated in the Introduction, while the context of UI is focuses more at the technical aspects of the interface, in terms of Usability and Utility, it was also said that even if a project could succeed in relation to usability and utility, it could still fail if thoses properties, principles and best practices of UX were not met.

Finally, it was also said in the Introduction that UX should have a broader context than UI, extending the relation of the user with the product and even the organization brand as a whole.
 

#### UX Basic Principles

1. **The Aesthetic-Usability Effect**: that users are more tolerant of minor usability issues when they find an interface visually appealing.     
	1.1. This effect can mask some UI problems, therefore the necessity to research and user testing.
2. **Doherty Threshold**: the necessity to optimize the interface to improve its reponse, thus also improve the user interaction with the system.
3. **Fitts' Law**: this principle is related with mesurements of the distances of the elements in the interface, and the impact they cause in the user ability to interact with it.
	3.1. So, elements too small or too distant will make hard for the user to interact.
4. **Hick-Hyman Law**: this principle is related with the complexity of the interface and how this can also affect the capacity of the user to interact with the system.     
	4.1. Thus, in order to dimiss some of the complexity it's possible to divide the interface into steps, so the user doesn't have to deal with everything at the same time.
5. **Jakob's Law**: a theorem from Jakob Nielsen that **the user pass more time navigating the web as a whole, than at some speciffic site, and therefore he will be more accostumed to interact interfaces that are more common in a broader sense**.     
	5.1. So, in terms of innovation, it's important that it may not be so disrupt as to cause confusion to the user.
6. **Pr√§gnanz Law**: this principle asserts that people tend to interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simple form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort.     
	6.1. Thus, also here there is the necessity to dismiss much of the complexities from the interface.
7. **Miller's Law**: this principle also state about complexity of the interface, but this time in terms of the Users Cognitive Memory and its use to retain information, since the theorem postulates that **the average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory**.
	7.1. Avoid an excessive number of choises and options.   
	7.2.  A good example, to simplify the informations at the interface is to format telephone numbers: `4008675309` Versus `(440) 867-5309`.
8. **Occam's Razor**: this is another principle that verses about economy and simplicity, where the principle states that for any given problem it should be chosen the simplest solution.
9. **Pareto's Principle**: this principle is also a general rule applied to the field of design, and it states that **80% of the results come as concequence of around 20% of the effort**.      
	9.1. As it can be applied to design, it's possible to assert that it could be practical reason to narrow the causally to the 20% strong variables, than to focus at the whole picture at a time.
10. **Parkinson's Law**: this principle is related to time and the away it can confuse the perception, as it states that **Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent**.     
	10.1. So, it should be sensible to work with limited time frames.  
	10.2.	To prefer shorten time frames.  
	10.3. Also to reflect about time frames in relation to the users tasks. For example, autocompleting forms, etc.
11. **Peak-End Rule**: this is a concept from psychology related to the formation of memory. It interprets that memories become strong channeled through peaks and near the end of some event. 
	11.1. Here there is the idea of progression in terms of experience, instead a unlimited occurence.     
	11.2. In terms of design, it could be tought as elements or points of focus that can relate to users at their progression on the site, just like rewards or reinforcements.   
	11.3. On the other hande, problems with navigation, illegible texts or intrusive advertisement, could retain a strong negative impression of the whole design.   
12. **Postel's Law**: this principle appears to come from the area of data transfering in developement, and states **Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send**.  
	12.1. In practical terms it could mean to be open to receive any kind of input from the user, but whenever it's necessary to give a feedback it should be very precise.   
	12.2. For example, on forms it is the responsability of the designer to simplify the inputs from the user. But on the other hand, when there is an error, the feedback should be clear and speciffic.   
13. **Serial-Position Effect**: this is the tendency of a person to better recall the first and last items in a series, than the middle items.   
	13.1. In terms of design, this could imply a hierarchy of contexts, for example, where the first and the last positions should be preferred in terms of importance.
14. **Tesler's Law**: also known as the Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexit which cannot be reduced and has to be dealt by the user or by the development..
	14.1. In terms of design, it could mean that the task of reducing complexit from the user would send it to development, and then creating the necessity to which side it would better convey.  
	14.2. Also, some tasks by the users or some speciffic users could be better served if they had more control over the task.
15. **Zeigarnik Effect**: this principle states that **people remember uncompleted or interrrupted tasks better than completed tasks**.       
	15.1. In terms of design, this effect could be used to create engagement with the user and motivate him to complete some task.   
	15.2. For exemple, the use of design elements like progression bars the help the user to be aware of the of some state in the site.
