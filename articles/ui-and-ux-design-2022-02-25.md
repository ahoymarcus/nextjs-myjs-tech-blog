### Introduction

UI and UX design are two important processes in software development, where:

1. **UI Design**: it stands to User Interface Design and it is related to deal with brand and visual styles and assets from the product.
2. **UX Design**: and this stands to User Experience Design, and it relates to the quality of interation between the user and the elements of the product and the services provided.


In the article from [Norman and Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/) about UX we learn that **User Experience** or **UX** is a process focused at the needs of the user, and that it goes beyond the mere requirements of proving the correct services to the user.

And perhaps here it is possible to divise a clear separantion of concerns between these two important process related to the product design. 

That is, while **UI** aims to design a interfce that meets all the system requirements and at the same time that should meet all the needed user requirements of Usability and Utility, that are processes related to the user and the quality of his interactions with the interface.

In that case, **Usability** and **Utility** are 
meant provide additional qualities to the interface, among others it could be said:

- **Easy to learn**
- **Efficient to use**
- **Pleasant**
- **Give the correct effect**
 
**Note**: about Usability and Utility, see also this article - _Usability Overview_[^1]
 

On the other hand, for a **UX** design to succeeded it should aim to extend the user experience of a service to its fullest. And it would imply that the service could extend the user enjoyment of ones product or brand.

In the article, Norman and Nielsen give a very interesting example of the difference in perspective of UX where in a Website with movie reviews, for example, even a perfect user interface design that could meets all the necessary quality attributes of UI needed, like easiness of interaction, correction of the service, but it could still lacks UX design of the product, because the lack of variaty in the topics provided or at the amount of information given to the user, and thus the UX design would still be underperforming in relation to the user experience.

`As an example, consider a website with movie reviews. Even if the UI for finding a film is perfect, the UX will be poor for a user who wants information about a small independent release if the underlying database only contains movies from the major studios.`
[Norman and Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/) 


Key differences according to the article from [Guru99.com](https://www.guru99.com/ui-vs-ux.html):

1. **UI design**: it is related to the interface and its relation to the interaction of the user with the product.   
2. **UX design**: it is related and focused with everything in the product that may affect the user commitment with a product.


### UI Designer Responsabilities

- The UI desiners needs to convert all the user requirements of the product into a captivating user interface.
- The UI designer must guide and instruct the visual journey of the user into the interface.
- The UI designer must provide all the necessary interactive elements nedd by the user.
- The UI designers must deal with al the psychological means related to the interface so it makes the interaction of the user more appealing and intuite.



### UI Basic Princiles

According to the article from [Mark Nunes](https://medium.com/ui-lab-school/os-princ%C3%ADpios-do-design-em-user-interface-80f300cb81e0), the craft of Design has some basic properties, and with the correct balance in the use of these properties could result in a good design.

The properties are:

1. **Axis**: this is a imaginary line that divides the body of the interface according to ratio, and weight, or moviment (like direction).
2. **Symmetry**: with this property it's possible to achieve the effect of balance or inbalance on the design, beign the first one related to the balance in the use of the visual elements, and the other in the use of some form of assymetry.
3. **Hierarchy**: this is a important property that can be used to define scope, for example, using Size and with it focal points.     
	3.1. Size   
	3.2. Form   
	3.3. Position
4. **Rhythm**: this property is related to pattern and repetition.     
	4.1. Pattern: it can be some king of grouping of elements that goes together throughout the design, like Title, Description and some Icon, for example.     
	4.2. Repetition: this attribute can define the flow of the recurring element or even some break in the flow and start of another, what could represent different contexts in the layout of the interface.


### UX Designer Responsabilities

- The UX designer must maps out the structure of the user journey.
