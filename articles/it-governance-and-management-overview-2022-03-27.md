### Introduction
 
To try to understand these two terms that seems particularly close, in an article, [Magowan](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/governance-vs-management/) starts this topic with a generic differentiation of the two ideas:

1. **Governance**: it should be more inline with the organization and its strategic directions.
2. **Management**: it should be more inline with transposing of the organization directives into action.


And taking off from that basic division, the author then brings some clarification to the matter applying some of the definitions from Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), which is a framework for governance and management specifically tailored to IT.

So, applying some of the underling ideas from COBIT, the problem could be presented this way:

1. **Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM)**: which would cover the main governance activities, to access and evaluate the needs of the stackholders, to direct through priorization and monitoring results.
2. **Plan, Build, Run, and Monitor (PBRM)**: which would cover the main management activities, that would mean to put the government dispositions into action and to be monitored.



### IT Government and IT Management


#### The Importance of IT Governance

**COMING SOON...**


#### The Importance of IT Management

Bringing the problem even more to the center of the IT Area, it could be said that IT Management have two basic functions:

1. To set and monitor the efficiency of the information systems infrastructure.
2. To prepare and help the workers to cope better with the IT operation.


So, considering that the IT resources have to available and functional at all times, there could be said that the IT Management responsabilities should include:

1. **Determining business requirements for IT systems**
2. **Managing IT budgets and costs**
3. **Monitoring safety and compliance**
4. **Controlling system and network security**
5. **Implementing new software, hardware and data systems**
6. **Providing technical or help desk support**


Since in the contemporary society guided by an information economy, it should be the responsability of IT management to make this connection between the business of the organization and the informational tools it effectively needs to succed.


`In turn, businesses who wish to remain competitive long-term must understand how to integrate IT services into their daily operations in a responsible and meaningful way.` [Trio.dev](https://trio.dev/blog/it-management)



### IT Strategic Planning

The idea of a strategic planning for the IT area is a concept that has been gaining strength since technology has become a important piece inside the organization of a company.


And for that, since IT today is much more than a provider of some restrict resources for business, but has become a important factor for the development of the whole operation, it also becomes important that the area of IT should update itself to adhere this new strategic role.


Some elements that should be around a IT strategic planning:

1. **To follow close the strategic business plans for the organization**
2. **To bring the IT area to correct adapt itself to the internal and external environment of the company**
3. **To correct allocate resources of infrastructure, budget, and professionals**
4. **To better understand its clients**
5. **To set directives and short, medium and long goals**
6. **To find overhead in the operation**
7. **To have a understand about the real position of the competition**


#### Advantages from IT Strategic Planning

1. o help the organization reach its strategic plans
2. Improving the positioning of the IT area in the company operation and the optimization in the use of technological resources
3. Reduction of costs and risks
4. To improve workflow
5. Brings transparency to the IT operation and help to define and monitor the priorities
6. To improve communication with the other departments of the organization
7. *Create means to measure and to analyse all the operation


#### Key Elements from the IT Strategic Planning

 1. **Mission**: it should state how the IT fits the strategic plans of the company and which should be its main efforts.
 2. **Diagnostics**: it means to have a descriptive vision of the IT area current state, both its strong poinst and short comings.   
    2.1. Its culture   
    2.2. The competition   
    2.3. The opportunities    
    2.4. The risks
3. **Priorities**: once it is clear the  main description for the IT area, it's time to define priorities, not only to tackle opportunities, but also to minimaze risks and short comings.
4. **Tactical Plan**: the should be a clear and concret paths to deal with the tasks ahead, and even in terms of short, medium, and in long term. 
5. **Roles and Responsabilities**: the roles and responsabilities should be very well known by each parson, and it also should be written and validated.
6. **Goals**: it's important that the plans and actions should have definive goals and quantified measures to define quality, just as to state the unacceptable results.
7. **Resources**: it's also very important to know that the resources are correct and sufficient to achieve each of the goals. Pehaps, to define also where to go for extra resources needed.


#### Errors in Planning

1. **Loose focus and low efficacy**: the planning has to be clear and pragmatic.    
    1.1. There should be a comprehensive calendar with timelines to be achieved.
2. **To treat the final document/plan as a mere formality**
3. **To await to the right time!**: the right time for the IT Strategic Planning should be the current time, meaning that the lack of plan is a problem, but that a existent plan has also to be put to action.
4. **A Rigid Plan**: the planning has to be flexible to be updated as to follow close potential changes, both internaly or externaly, that may change perspective over past decisions.
5. **A inbalanced plan**: the plan should be aware both of short goals, as of long goals. To miss either part of the equation could result in loss for the company. 



### COBIT

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are a set of best practices and recommendations for IT Governance to promote security and quality within the IT operations, and it was developed in the 1990s by the IT Governance Institute.


`The COBIT Framework provides a tool for the business process owner that affect the discharge of business process tasks. COBIT is an IT-centric framework designed to provide users, businesses, and auditors with a standard approach for designing, implementing, and testing IT controls. This framework has been created and adopted by the Big N audit houses as a solution to some IT audit, compliance, and control problems.` [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-cobit-in-information-security)


Moreover, COBIT provides maturity models, critical success factors, main objective indicators, and implementation indicators, administrative guidelines, etc.


There is also certifications related to this framework, which aims to showcase the IT professinal knowledge on the COBIT `foundations` and `principles`, and to bring him closer to the core of the organization and its strategic plans.

1. **COBIT 5 Foundation**
2. **COBIT 5 Implementation**
3. **COBIT 5 Assessor**


###### Note: the certification does not have a validation date and has a 50% correction for approvement.


There is a set of tasks that are inherent to the scope of IT operations, and that should be addressed with high priority:

- **Information Management**
- **IT Services Monitoring**
- **The Work Force**
- **Security**
- **Data Administration**
- **Crisis Contaiment**


Another important point about COBIT is that it does not prevent its use together with other frameworks, like the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which is more inline with tasks management inside the IT department and its operartions..


So, while thinking about the use of COBIT together with ITIL, there should be on the first  then the aim to optimize the process and stages related to IT Governance, and on the second the best practices to achieve value to the company while the IT services are put to use for the whole operation.



#### Funcionalities from COBIT 5   

1. Planning and Organizing
2. Acquirement and Organization
3. Deliver and Support
4. Monitoring and Evaluation


#### Principles from COBIT 5

1. **Meeting stakeholders needs**: since IT correlates to different parts of the administration, from strategic planning to the daily IT process, it should also meet the expectation of each involved part.
2. **Covering the enterprise end to end**: since IT process spred acress all the department and operations, it is necessary that each and all of them should account to the IT assets and their assessment to the strategic plannig.
3. **Applying a single integrated framework**: meaning that even when COBIT is used together with other frameworks, they should all be integrated to cover a broader, but single IT Governance and Management.
4. **Enabling a holistic approach**: this should imply that the effort with IT Governance and Management should involve every diverse field of the organizations:   
    4.1. Departments   
    4.2. Processes   
    4.3. Activities   
    4.4. Resources and finantial assets   
    4.5. Culture, etc.
5. **Separating governance from management**: here, there is the importance of creating some layers in the operation, and to separate each concern accordingly, from the evaluation of the quality and security of day-by-day management of processes, to the monitoring and evaluation of strategic goals and the value achieved.


#### Advantages from the COBIT Framework

1. Strategic planning and IT department alignment
2. Transparency form plans and goals
3. Quality of the service
4. Improve the value of IT operation
5. Productivity
6. Compliance 
7. Risk assessment


### PMBOK

The Project Management Body of Knowledge is a guide for project management, developed by the Project Management Institute (PMI), and although the PMBOK may appear to bring a broad range of sujects , it may not be confused with a methodology, because in reality a standardizations and a best practice guide.


The PMBOK is not a methodology, because it stays in a more generic layer, which does not touch on specific traits like the many kinds of project, wheter it is construction, software, or other kind of project there is. It was first released in 1983, and recentrly in 2017 released its 6th edition.


And since this guide is internationally reconized (IEEE, ANSI), and PMI is largest not-for-profit organization for Project Management, PMBOK is largely used for professional software development projects.


`The PMBOK serves to promote and establish a common vocabulary for the project management profession by suggesting tools and techniques for each process and guiding in defining inputs and outputs as well. It describes the basic concepts of Project, Project Management, the role of Project Manager in different organizational structures, Project Management Phases, and the Project Lifecycle.` [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article)


These are some of the wide scope/constraints that the PMBOK works:

- **Scope**
- **Quality**
- **Schedule**
- **Budget**
- **Resources**
- **Risk**


#### Brief History of the PMBOK

Eventhough have been efforts to produce documents to support project management dating from **1981**, it was only in **1996** that in this First Edition a truly systematic document was launched.


There were an update in **2000** with the lauching of the Second Edition, but it was with the Third Edition in **2004** that the PMI institute had to organize and inaugurate a commitee to help in cataloging all the numerous participations soliciting changes. And it was in this 3rd edition that the guide increased generalize all kinds of projects.


The Fourth Edition in **2009** had it focus on acceessement, in a effort to make the document more consistent and accessible. And then in **2013** came the Fifth Edition, where the focus was especially in standardization of the terms, the processes, the inputs and the outputs.


Then, in **2017** came the Sixth Edition, which added new processes, but that kept special focus on the role and the compentencies for the Project Manager.



#### PMBOK Fifth Edition

According to the site [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article), the 5th edition introduced 'Stakeholder Management' as another of its knowledge areas.


And at this edition, the PMBOK guide interwinds 5 'process groups' with 10 'knowledge areas':

###### Process groups:
1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring and Controlling
5. Closing or finishing

###### Knowledge areas:
1. Project Integration Management
2. Project Scope Management
3. Project Time Management
4. Project Cost Management
5. Project Quality Management
6. Project Human Resource Management
7. Project Communications Management
8. Project Risk Management
9. Project Procurement Management
10. Project Stakeholder Management


#### PMBOK Sixth Edition

This newer edition included another features like **Agile (Adaptive PM)**, **3 new group processes**, **updated naming conventions**, **closing Procurement is closed**, **project Manager's role**.


###### Agile (Apaptive PM)

Still according to the site [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article), since Agile practices are a big part of nowdays projects, this same philosophy that was mentioned in the PMBOK 5th Ed, has been extensive been included in this later edition: 

- **Agile**
- **Scrum**
- **Kanban**
- **Lean**
- **XP**


###### New Group Processes

From the original 47 processes in the 5th edition, one was removed, and the bellow 3 were added:

- **Knowledge Management**
- **Risk Management**
- **Control Resources**


###### Project Manager's Role

Also according to the site [SimpliLearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article), considering the constantly changing role of the project manager and how leadership in project management is approached, this section now addresses PMI's Talent Triangle to encompass the **strategic**, **leadership**, and **technical** project management competencies and skills that a modern project manager should have.


#### The Concept of Project in the PMBOK

According to the site [ProjectBuilder.com](https://www.projectbuilder.com.br/blog/o-que-e-pmbok/), the PMBOK lays some guaidances on the form of a project, espcially in contrast to other tasks or operations, like ordinary processes, which can also to be found at the organizations:

1. **Defined timeline**: a project is a finite task that must have a start and a ending point limiting its life cycle.
2. **Exclusive objectives**: as a entity, a project also diferentiate itself by its objectives and goals.
3. **Limited resources**: since projects are not continous entities, but have finite time span and delimited objectives, it also must have limited resources related to it.


#### Advantages of PMBOK

Among many other benefits to the management of projects, its possible to underline:

1. **Standardization of terms and processes**
2. **Improvement in the flow of communication among the interested parties**
3. **More emphasis of the important tasks**
4. **Better usage of the resources**: including time.
5. **Improvement on the monitoring of the project stages**
6. **Better accessement of Risks**
7. **Better rates of project success**


#### The Agile Project Management and the PMBOK Guide

This very interesting section of the PMBOK Overview brings the article [Agile project management and the PMBOK® guide](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042), from 2008, where the PMI.org to try to understand the relation between this two important concepts of modern management: PMBOK and Agile methods.

So, alread at the beginning the article makes referece to this misconception into thinnking that the PMBOK 3rd Edition is more inlined with traditional software development, like the Waterfall Model, and should not be used with the Agile models.


Then, in its development, the article starts with a brief development of the PMI and the PMBOK, where from **1966** to **1983** a group of researches would contrbute with experiences and create some reports on project managemet and standards.

Then, only in **1996** a systematic document was published with as the First Edition of the Project Managment Body of Knowledge, which later would become a standard itself for good pratices in project management. Then the 2nd Edition in **2000** and the 3rd Edition in **2004**:


`Although the PMBOK® Guide does not dictate methodology, many software project managers nevertheless began to associate the waterfall model with the processes outlined in the PMBOK® Guide. Perhaps it was because waterfall was the prevalent methodology at the time, or perhaps it was because the waterfall model provided a framework that supported all of the PMBOK® Guide practices. Whatever the reason, it has been a hard misconception to shake, even though the third edition of the PMBOK® Guide makes it very clear that it is up to the reader to determine what processes are most appropriate to use in their situation.` [PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042)


And the authors from PMI.org really admit that in the 2000 edition, it was still difficult to see agile practices outilined in the PMBOK, but says that in the 2004 edition this points were alredy more clearly stated:

1. `There is no single best way to define an ideal project life cycle` (PMI, 2004, p. 20)
2. `the project manager, in collaboration with the project team, is always responsible for determining what processes are appropriate, and the appropriate degree of rigor for each process, for any given project`. (PMI, 2004, p.37)


And in the [PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042) site the authors also add many more instances, like articles and magazines, where the concepts were public stated.  


###### Project Life Cycle

The PMBOK 3rd Edition calls a projet life clycle as a `collection of generally sequential project phases`, there is a logical grouping of related activities that usually culminate in a deliverable.


![pmbok-project-life-cycle-01](/images/articles/development/pmbok-project-life-cycle-01.jpg)


And it continues that traditionally these phases were more clear to be understood as the ones seen in the Waterfall Model, but that this concret correlation ware never mandatory.

So, as the article progress, it states that the 'sequential' aspect of the timeline, specially with its required sign-offs, were seen more inlined with the Waterfall Model, but there is also a inherent sequentiality inside the Agile Model, more properly called 'Iteraction', and also the intermediary releases or deployments to the client with each iteration.


`This is the type of phrasing that might lead readers to believe that only a waterfall methodology is appropriate when following PMBOK® Guide practices. However if we interpret “hand-off” to mean that there is a hand-off of an increment of code to the customer to use as they see fit, then agile is still in keeping with the basic tenets of the PMBOK® Guide.`  [PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042) 


Finally, the author cleary contradict those that propose that each of the Agile iterations were a project by itself, saying that this concept, for them, really comes from those that are in fact putting the Waterfall model in the center of the argument by themselves:

`Because of this regular rhythm of incremental delivery, many have proffered that each iteration of an agile project is itself a project, having a start and stop date, and delivering a product as a result. I disagree with this assessment, however, believing it to be colored by years of waterfall practice.`[PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-pmbok-waterfall-7042) 


The authors even remide that the PMBOK clearly states that projects are `undertaken to crate a lasting outcome` (PMI, 2004, p.5), contrary to the idea that the sgin-offs should be accounted to each iteration was a project by itself, and not to the software development was a whole.


![pmbok-project-life-cycle-01](/images/articles/development/pmbok-project-life-cycle-02.jpg)


###### The Point Where there is a Clear Difference

And then, only in a singular point the authors reconigze that there are a clear difference of concepts between PMBOK and Agile pratices, and that is about **the participation of the stackholders**.


So, for the Agile model, the stackholders are called to have active involvement throughout the duration of the project, while in the `PMBOK Guide the view that stackeholder influence occurs up front and then declines throughout the rest of the project`. (PMI, 2004, p. 21)

### ITIL
 
**COMING SOON...**
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

### Indicators Methodologies
 
Just as the frameworks concerning governance and management that exist in the market, there are also smaller frameworks and specialized frameworks to deal with indicators and measurement tools.

Two of these indicators are **KPI** and **OKR**, and eventhough sometimes the may overlap each other in some aspects, they should be treated as different and specific tools. And there are also many others indicators, like **BSC**, etc.


#### KPI Indicator

This is the acronym for Key Performance Indicator (KPI), and it is `used to evaluate performance over time for an organization, individual, program, project, action, etc.` [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)


And in the article linked above, the author sees 3 specific indicators that may vary a little bit and be some what confused with the concepts measured by other tools, like OKR, for exemple:

1. **Link to strategic objectives**
2. **Direct where to focus resources**
3. **Be measured against targets**


###### Some notes on KPI Indicators: 
1. This indicator should always be designed in a quantative nature, because as it is taught by some, it makes easier to provide context and for comparing performace.
2. They should be specific (not vague), and should have context and meaning for each KPI.
3. They must me **Key features** or indicators from strategic level.


- Some exemples of the use KPI indicators [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/):
- **Retail Industry**: revenue per square foot, same-store sales, sales per employee.
- **HR Department**: attrition rate, employee performance, average recruitment time.
- **Sales Department**: customer lifetime value, sales revenue, calls made.
- **Technology Industry**: monthly recurring revenue, customer retention or churn, ticket resolution time.
- **Healthcare Industry**: patient wait time, average treatment charge, number of educational programs.


#### OKR Indicator
 
On the other hand, OKR is the acronym for Objective and Key Results, or more specifically `an objective is tied to key results. OKR is a strategic framework, whereas KPIs are measurements that exist witin a framework`. [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)
 

The same article also states that OKR has a more simplistic fashion as a framework, which groups a limited number of high-level objectives to some, also a limited number of key results per objective.


Some characteristics a OKR should have:

1. **Always quantifiable**
2. **Able to be objectively scored on a 0-1 or 0-100 scale**
3. **Timelined**

###### Some notes on OKR Indicators: 
1. They must have alignment with the rest of the orginization, especially beign created from top down in the company structure.
2. These indicators are better fitted for strategic impruvements, so they are not the best fit for focusing on mainataining the pace of processes.
 
 
#### BSC Indicator
 
Balance Score Card (BSC) is a strategic planning and management system, and it is use with the aim of:

- **Communicate goals to be accomplished**
- **Align the day-to-day work with the organization strategy**
- **Prioritizing projects, products, and services**
- **Measure and monitor progress toward strategic targets**


According to the [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/), the concept of the name 'Balance Scorecard' comes from the idea of a more balanced approach to strategically measuring organizations or processes besides the limited traditional financial measurements.


`The concept of balanced scorecard has evolved beyond the simple use of perspectives and it is now a holistic system for managing strategy. A key benefit of using a disciplined framework is that it gives organizations a way to “connect the dots” between the various components of strategic planning and management, meaning that there will be a visible connection between the projects and programs that people are working on, the measurements being used to track success (KPIs), the strategic objectives the organization is trying to accomplish, and the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization.`  [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/)
 
 
And according to a article from [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard), this same concept from Kaplan & Norton with the BSC idea became a foundational principle in the evaluation of Governance, business strategy, and management performance, for short, medium, and also long term. 


`The inference was that organizations could enhance their creation of value and enterprise performance by improving the management of their non-financial, intangible assets, through the integration of these into their existing performance management systems. As the saying goes, if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it… so in retrospect it seemed inevitable that non-financial measures would emerge as critical to the overall performance management of the enterprise.` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)
 
 
And the BSC concept also suggets that an organization should be examined from four different perspectives:

1. **Financial (or Stewardship)**: measure an organization's financial performance and also its use of the resources finantially.
2. **Customer/Stakeholder**: it focuses on performance from the point of view of customers or from the point of view of stackholders.
3. **Internal Process**: this measure is focused on the quality and efficiency of processes and products, or other key business factor.
4. **Organization Capacity (or Learning & Growth)**: this last area has the focus on the different kinds of capital and values from the organization:   
    4.1. Human capital  
    4.2. Infrastructure   
    4.3. Technology  
    4.4. Culture    
    4.5. Any other capacity that may bring breakthrough performance.


###### BSC and COBIT 5

So, for [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard), it became no surprise that a framework that has widen the scope of governance beyond the mere financial view, but to also include intangible assets would merge perfectly into the COBIT 5 environment.
 

Another interesting point underlined from the above site, though, it is the fact that the BSC and COBIT 5 especially fit into a cohese system concerning the point of **The stackholders** which cascades down to the more specific areas. 
 
`The BSC provides for a balanced, holistic view of the Enterprise, and by using the BSC as a common tool to represent and align Enterprise and IT goals, COBIT 5 has provided an essential snapshot of the total value delivery of Enterprise IT to the organization.` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)



### Project Management Methodologies
 
According to the site [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/) there over 8,462 project management methodologies around, but in its article it states some of the more popular ones:
 
So, in general terms a project management methodology is a set of principles and practices, that is a framework, that guide the organization of projects to ensure maximum performance. 
 
And some of the reazons the site gives for the great number of methodology highlight the fact that each project has its specific requirements and also its own context, and they should not be simplily handled down by a one-size-fits-all methodology.

Even more, that could be times when some set of principles and practices simply don't macht some kind of methodologies, and they should never be forced to fit into such direction.


But there should be some attributes or characteristics that could help to decide between one or another methodology:

- **Cost and Budget**: here, not only the amount, but also if there is flexibility to change it during the project course.
- **Team size**: in this case there should be analysed not only the quantity of professionals, but also characteristics about seniority level, leadership, etc.
-  **Ability to take risks**: some methodologies are more open to risks than others.
- **Flexibility**: in this case there is the analysis about the possibilities to changes in the direction during the project life cycle.
- **Timeline**: in this case there should be analysed how strict is the timeline, the possibilities of its increase or decrease, etc.
- **Cient/Stackholder collaboration**: in this case it is view how much does the client need/wants to be involved in the process.
