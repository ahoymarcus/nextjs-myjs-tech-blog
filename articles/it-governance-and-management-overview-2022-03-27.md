### Introduction
 
To try to understand these two terms that seems particularly close, in an article, [Magowan](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/governance-vs-management/) starts this topic with a generic differentiation of the two ideas:

1. **Governance**: it should be more inline with the organization and its strategic directions.
2. **Management**: it should be more inline with transposing of the organization directives into action.


And taking off from that basic division, the author then brings some clarification to the matter applying some of the definitions from Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), which is a framework for governance and management specifically tailored to IT.

So, applying some of the underling ideas from COBIT, the problem could be presented this way:

1. **Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM)**: which would cover the main governance activities, to access and evaluate the needs of the stakeholders, to direct through priorization and monitoring results.
2. **Plan, Build, Run, and Monitor (PBRM)**: which would cover the main management activities, that would mean to put the government dispositions into action and to be monitored.

### IT Government and IT Management


#### The Importance of IT Governance

**COMING SOON...**


#### The Importance of IT Management

Bringing the problem even more to the center of the IT Area, it could be said that IT Management have two basic functions:

1. To set and monitor the efficiency of the information systems infrastructure.
2. To prepare and help the workers to cope better with the IT operation.


So, considering that the IT resources have to available and functional at all times, there could be said that the IT Management responsabilities should include:

1. **Determining business requirements for IT systems**
2. **Managing IT budgets and costs**
3. **Monitoring safety and compliance**
4. **Controlling system and network security**
5. **Implementing new software, hardware and data systems**
6. **Providing technical or help desk support**


Since in the contemporary society guided by an information economy, it should be the responsability of IT management to make this connection between the business of the organization and the informational tools it effectively needs to succed.


`In turn, businesses who wish to remain competitive long-term must understand how to integrate IT services into their daily operations in a responsible and meaningful way.` [Trio.dev](https://trio.dev/blog/it-management)



### IT Strategic Planning

The idea of a strategic planning for the IT area is a concept that has been gaining strength since technology has become a important piece inside the organization of a company.


And for that, since IT today is much more than a provider of some restrict resources for business, but has become a important factor for the development of the whole operation, it also becomes important that the area of IT should update itself to adhere this new strategic role.


Some elements that should be around a IT strategic planning:

1. **To follow close the strategic business plans for the organization**
2. **To bring the IT area to correct adapt itself to the internal and external environment of the company**
3. **To correct allocate resources of infrastructure, budget, and professionals**
4. **To better understand its clients**
5. **To set directives and short, medium and long goals**
6. **To find overhead in the operation**
7. **To have a understand about the real position of the competition**


#### Advantages from IT Strategic Planning

1. o help the organization reach its strategic plans
2. Improving the positioning of the IT area in the company operation and the optimization in the use of technological resources
3. Reduction of costs and risks
4. To improve workflow
5. Brings transparency to the IT operation and help to define and monitor the priorities
6. To improve communication with the other departments of the organization
7. *Create means to measure and to analyse all the operation


#### Key Elements from the IT Strategic Planning

 1. **Mission**: it should state how the IT fits the strategic plans of the company and which should be its main efforts.
 2. **Diagnostics**: it means to have a descriptive vision of the IT area current state, both its strong poinst and short comings.   
    2.1. Its culture   
    2.2. The competition   
    2.3. The opportunities    
    2.4. The risks
3. **Priorities**: once it is clear the  main description for the IT area, it's time to define priorities, not only to tackle opportunities, but also to minimaze risks and short comings.
4. **Tactical Plan**: the should be a clear and concret paths to deal with the tasks ahead, and even in terms of short, medium, and in long term. 
5. **Roles and Responsabilities**: the roles and responsabilities should be very well known by each parson, and it also should be written and validated.
6. **Goals**: it's important that the plans and actions should have definive goals and quantified measures to define quality, just as to state the unacceptable results.
7. **Resources**: it's also very important to know that the resources are correct and sufficient to achieve each of the goals. Pehaps, to define also where to go for extra resources needed.


#### Errors in Planning

1. **Loose focus and low efficacy**: the planning has to be clear and pragmatic.    
    1.1. There should be a comprehensive calendar with timelines to be achieved.
2. **To treat the final document/plan as a mere formality**
3. **To await to the right time!**: the right time for the IT Strategic Planning should be the current time, meaning that the lack of plan is a problem, but that a existent plan has also to be put to action.
4. **A Rigid Plan**: the planning has to be flexible to be updated as to follow close potential changes, both internaly or externaly, that may change perspective over past decisions.
5. **A inbalanced plan**: the plan should be aware both of short goals, as of long goals. To miss either part of the equation could result in loss for the company. 



### Kinds of Methodology Indicators 
 
Just as the frameworks concerning governance and management that exist in the market, there are also smaller frameworks and specialized frameworks to deal with indicators and measurement tools.

Two of these indicators are **KPI** and **OKR**, and eventhough sometimes the may overlap each other in some aspects, they should be treated as different and specific tools. And there are also many others indicators, like **BSC**, etc.


#### KPI Indicator

This is the acronym for Key Performance Indicator (KPI), and it is `used to evaluate performance over time for an organization, individual, program, project, action, etc.` [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)


And in the article linked above, the author sees 3 specific indicators that may vary a little bit and be some what confused with the concepts measured by other tools, like OKR, for exemple:

1. **Link to strategic objectives**
2. **Direct where to focus resources**
3. **Be measured against targets**


###### Some notes on KPI Indicators: 
1. This indicator should always be designed in a quantative nature, because as it is taught by some, it makes easier to provide context and for comparing performace.
2. They should be specific (not vague), and should have context and meaning for each KPI.
3. They must me **Key features** or indicators from strategic level.


- Some exemples of the use KPI indicators [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/):
- **Retail Industry**: revenue per square foot, same-store sales, sales per employee.
- **HR Department**: attrition rate, employee performance, average recruitment time.
- **Sales Department**: customer lifetime value, sales revenue, calls made.
- **Technology Industry**: monthly recurring revenue, customer retention or churn, ticket resolution time.
- **Healthcare Industry**: patient wait time, average treatment charge, number of educational programs.


#### OKR Indicator
 
On the other hand, OKR is the acronym for Objective and Key Results, or more specifically `an objective is tied to key results. OKR is a strategic framework, whereas KPIs are measurements that exist witin a framework`. [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)
 

The same article also states that OKR has a more simplistic fashion as a framework, which groups a limited number of high-level objectives to some, also a limited number of key results per objective.


Some characteristics a OKR should have:

1. **Always quantifiable**
2. **Able to be objectively scored on a 0-1 or 0-100 scale**
3. **Timelined**
4. **Ambitious**: the objectives and the results should be some what hard to reach or some distinctive in that nature.


- Some exemples of the use OKR indicators [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/):
1. Objective: Become the market leader in our industry.     
    1.1. Key result #1: record $100 million in revenue.   
    1.2. Key result #2: increase staff by 45 percent.   
    1.3. Key result #3: increase market cap suffieciently to enter S&P 500.
2. Objective: Develop autonomous vehicles.   
    2.1. Key result #1: hire 10 artificial intelligence subject matter experts.   
    2.2. Key result #2: invest an additional $500 million in research and development.   
    2.3. Key result #3: roll out prototype by fiscal year-end.
3. Objective: Increase revenue by 30 percent.   
    3.1. Key result #1: acquire 50 new customers.   
    3.2. Key result #2: increase marketing leads by 20 percent.   
    3.3. Key resutl #3: increase customer retention to 85 percent.


###### Some notes on OKR Indicators: 
1. They must have alignment with the rest of the orginization, especially beign created from top down in the company structure.
2. These indicators are better fitted for strategic impruvements, so they are not the best fit for focusing on mainataining the pace of processes.
 
 
#### BSC Indicator
 
Balance Score Card (BSC) is a strategic planning and management system, and it is use with the aim of:

- **Communicate goals to be accomplished**
- **Align the day-to-day work with the organization strategy**
- **Prioritizing projects, products, and services**
- **Measure and monitor progress toward strategic targets**


According to the [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/), the concept of the name 'Balance Scorecard' comes from the idea of a more balanced approach to strategically measuring organizations or processes besides the limited traditional financial measurements.


`The concept of balanced scorecard has evolved beyond the simple use of perspectives and it is now a holistic system for managing strategy. A key benefit of using a disciplined framework is that it gives organizations a way to “connect the dots” between the various components of strategic planning and management, meaning that there will be a visible connection between the projects and programs that people are working on, the measurements being used to track success (KPIs), the strategic objectives the organization is trying to accomplish, and the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization.`  [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/)
 
 
And according to a article from [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard), this same concept from Kaplan & Norton with the BSC idea became a foundational principle in the evaluation of Governance, business strategy, and management performance, for short, medium, and also long term. 


`The inference was that organizations could enhance their creation of value and enterprise performance by improving the management of their non-financial, intangible assets, through the integration of these into their existing performance management systems. As the saying goes, if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it… so in retrospect it seemed inevitable that non-financial measures would emerge as critical to the overall performance management of the enterprise.` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)
 
 
And the BSC concept also suggets that an organization should be examined from four different perspectives:

1. **Financial (or Stewardship)**: measure an organization's financial performance and also its use of the resources finantially.
2. **Customer/Stakeholder**: it focuses on performance from the point of view of customers or from the point of view of stakeholders.
3. **Internal Process**: this measure is focused on the quality and efficiency of processes and products, or other key business factor.
4. **Organization Capacity (or Learning & Growth)**: this last area has the focus on the different kinds of capital and values from the organization:   
    4.1. Human capital  
    4.2. Infrastructure   
    4.3. Technology  
    4.4. Culture    
    4.5. Any other capacity that may bring breakthrough performance.


###### BSC and COBIT 5

So, for [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard), it became no surprise that a framework that has widen the scope of governance beyond the mere financial view, but to also include intangible assets would merge perfectly into the COBIT 5 environment.
 

Another interesting point underlined from the above site, though, it is the fact that the BSC and COBIT 5 especially fit into a cohese system concerning the point of **The stakeholders** which cascades down to the more specific areas. 
 
`The BSC provides for a balanced, holistic view of the Enterprise, and by using the BSC as a common tool to represent and align Enterprise and IT goals, COBIT 5 has provided an essential snapshot of the total value delivery of Enterprise IT to the organization.` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)



### Kinds of Management Tools

#### SWOT Analysis   

The acronym SWOT stads for Strenghs, Weakeness, Opportunities, and Threats, which are all attributes for analysis and are divided into 2 categories:

1. **Internal factors**:  
    1.1. Strenghts: they can be any kind of resource, either tangible or intangible, that the organization have.   
    1.2. Weakeness
2. **External factors**:   
    2.1. Opportunities   
    2.2. Threats


According to the site [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/swot-analysis.htm), the SWOT Analysis is the most renowned tool for audit and analysis, where in its use for analysis it becomes a key element for governance to identify and define strategies for the business model.
    

So, in its form, the tool aims to help evaluating the internal potentials ans limitations of a organization, service or process, and also to find and measure opportunities and threats externally.
    

###### Advantages of SWOT Analysis

It is a simple methodology that can be use in vasts areas and operations, but its also a subjective tool, and that is why the [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/swot-analysis.htm) states that, this tool is `best when used as a guide, and not as a prescription`:

1. It's a source of information for strategic planning.
2. Builds organization's strengths.
3. Reverse its weakneness.
4. Maximaze its response to opportunities.
5. Overcome organizations's threats.
6. It helps in identifying core competencies of the firm.
7. I helps in setting of objectives for strategic planning.


###### Limitations of SWOT Analysis

There are 2 basic limitations for this tool:

1. **Subjectivity**: as it was said, there is a great part of subjective as to define all these categories within the tool.
2. **Lack of depth**: its simplistic elements to create definition and categorization may cause inconsistances while defining strategic plans.



#### RACI Matrix

According to the site [SoftwareAdvice.com](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/what-is-a-raci-chart/), the RACI Matrix, also called RACI Chart or RACI Model, is a diagram that identifies the key roles and responsabilities of users against major tasks within a project, while it also servers as visual representation of the functional role played by each person on a project team.


The acronym stands for **Responsible**, **Accountable**, **Consulted**, and **Informed**, all of which defines attributes for the roles and levels of involvement of each professional within a project.

More over, the site also gives a `PRO TIP`, explaining that within this tool, responsabilities should better be definied in individual terms `as to avoid confusion and slow decision-making`. [SoftwareAdvice.com](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/what-is-a-raci-chart/)


And the site also clearly states this about the importance of clarity among roles and responsabilities for projects:

`Having managed and rescued dozens of projects, and helped others do so, I’ve noted that there is always one critical success factor (CSF) that has either been effectively addressed or missed/messed up: clarity around the roles and responsibilities for each project participant and key stakeholder. No matter how detailed and complete a project plan may be for any project, confusion or omission of participant roles and responsibilities will cause major problems.` [Cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/287088/project-management-how-to-design-a-successful-raci-project-plan.html)



1. **Responsible**: this attribute refers to a person directly related to work in a task/process at hand.  
    1.1. But this attribute does not imply the possibility that other persons may be also responsible for that same task/process to be made.
2. **Accountable**: this is a exclusive attribute which imparts ownership over the task/processe to one the one person which will attain the sole voice to give account about it.
3. **Consulted**: these are people or stakeholders who need to give their input before any work can be done or sign-off.
4. **Informed**: again, these are people or stakeholder who need to be kept informed about any progress in relation to the task/process.   
    4.1. Although they do not contribute directly to the task/process.


The site also cite a quotation from Gartner where it states the importance of clearly defining all the related authority and responsabilities for each endeavour that aims to be successful. 


And the that site makes another interesting distinction when it adverts that the RACI Chart diagram does not replace any methodology for planning and managing, but it gives important help to all that same management processes in setting responsabilities visually and in simple terms.


###### Steps to Create a RACI Matrix

The site [Cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/287088/project-management-how-to-design-a-successful-raci-project-plan.html) also gives a interesting example on how to build a RACI diagram:

1. Indentify all taks involved in delivering the project and list them along the left site of the chart.
2. Identify all the project stakeholders and list then along the top of the chart.
3. Complete the cells of the model identifying that 4 fold responsabilities already mentioned.
4. Ensure that every taks has to have one stakeholder to account for it.
5. Complete the aggrement among all parts in relation to what has been defined and documented in the tool's diagram.

![raci-matrix-example-01](/images/articles/development/raci-matrix-example-01.png)


###### RACI Matrix Best Practices

1. **Don't get too granular**: the RACI matrix is not the project plan, it is solely a visual tool to give agility into responsabilities.
2. **Too much reusability of the diagram**: though a good diagram can be reused eventually, but considering the specific context of each task/project, this should be done with care and understanding.
3. **Lack of consistency**: the roles defined on the diagram must reflect the real representation of the the work to be done in a task/project. There can be no arbitrary replaciments involved.
4. **Adding too many columns**: the diagram should be clear and simple, adding only key tasks.   
    4.1. So, do not add administrative tasks, like team meetings, for example.
5. **Mixing up who is responsible for who is accountable**: the person designated as 'responsible' for some task should not also be 'accountable' for the same task.   
    5.1. Besides, this add a layer of compliance to the tool. 
6. **Too many assignments given to one stakeholder**: this can lead to performance issues.
7. **There can be no empty cells left behind**: since the tool aims to birng key tasks, there should not be important element unsigned in terms of responsabilities in the task/project document.
8. **Clear aggrements**: there should be clear aggrement about the responsabilities taken in the document.



### Project Management Office (PMO)

Project Management Office (PMO) is a new feature in governance and management that aims to be a link or bridge in an organization between the strategic departments and the production departments responsible for projects/services. 


It brings effort to create a professional structure to create some standardization for the processes, creating tools and methods to support the production teams, while stays connceted to the strategic demands from the stakeholder.


As the site [Bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/pmo-project-management-office/) states, there has been a shift in the way some departments offer services of develop projects, where Agile methods has been taking over and directing many of the practices.


Some of the results from this change is that the working teams are less focused on the top-down hierarchy of the compony and more aligned with its own responsabilities:

1. Focus on the aspect of the product they're working on 
2. Continously development of the services and products: making decisions and increasing the whole experience.


The problem with this new set is that it can result in some form of gap between the production from services/products and the business strategy:


`Some DevOps teams lose focus on the consumer’s needs and the company’s resources and focus entirely on releasing new features whether they’re necessary or not. Not all businesses seemed ideal for the application of Agile practices, especially without adding modifications such as standardized procedures. Establishing a core set of best practices and standards for all projects throughout the organization was a key for these companies to ensure everyone could maintain the newly expected pace while still delivering quality results.`  [Bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/pmo-project-management-office/)


So, it is in this sense that a PMO team or deparment can be valuable for uniting both the efforts from production and from management, where the PMO can make this two set of works:

1. To represent stakeholders and keep the effectiveness of the business model and its strategies.
2. Help the effort of productions teams to complete projects and also to monitor the effectiveness of the projects procedures that were outlined.


The site [ProjectBuilder.com](https://www.projectbuilder.com.br/blog/project-management-office-tudo-o-que-voce-precisa-saber/) brings another important tasks that the PMO can use to improve management:

1. **To consolidate documents and best practices across the organization**: this can be especially providential when a organization has a diverse group of production and also has changes within its personal.
2. **Support and brace up project managers**: not only in the context of the group led by the project manager, but also across other groups inside the organization that can collaborate and share resources.


Besides, the same site above, [ProjectBuilder.com](https://www.projectbuilder.com.br/blog/project-management-office-tudo-o-que-voce-precisa-saber/) also brings some numbers about the problem related to projects complition. For that the site cites two reports:

1. **68% of projects does not reach the goals from timeframe, costs, or scope**: from CHAOS Standish, from 2009.
2. **From 1524 organizations, innadequate plannings and evaluations are responsible for 30% of the project failures**: and the second from a research from [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/ceosurvey).


#### Primary Functions from a PMO

1. **Project management delivery**
2. **Schedule, costs and scope management**
3. **Communication**
4. **Resources management**
5. **Projects integration**
6. **Risk management**
7. **Monitoring patters, methodologies and processes**
8. **Metodology definition**
9. **Processes improvement**
10. **Definition of metrics**
11. **Governance and performance management**
12. **Performance reports**
13. **Sharing information**


#### The 3 Basic Types of a PMO

1. **Corporative or centralized PMO**: this type is closer to the governance of the organization, and its responsabilities are more inline with bringing strategic value to the organization.   
    1.1. This kind is not the the more prevalent PMO to be found at the organizations.
2. **Delivery PMO**: the PMO is closer to the tactical execution of the projects, bringing support and monitioring to the teams to achieve the business expectations.    
    2.1. This are the most common type.
3. **Complience PMO**: they are usually related to organizations where there are speciffic processes necessary because regulartory reasons.
4. **Controlling PMO**: it is a kind of PMO that asserts a bit more of its presence amont the teams and can make use of audits. 
5. **Directive PMO**: this one is the most enforcing kind there is, where comes from its responsability many, and even most, of the directives demanded from the teams.   
    5.1. Distributes resources.   
    5.2. Distributes responsabilities   
    5.3. Defines the management for the teams.



### Concepts of Risk Management

**Coming Soon...**

















### COBIT

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are a set of best practices and recommendations for IT Governance to promote security and quality within the IT operations, and it was developed in the 1990s by the IT Governance Institute.


`The COBIT Framework provides a tool for the business process owner that affect the discharge of business process tasks. COBIT is an IT-centric framework designed to provide users, businesses, and auditors with a standard approach for designing, implementing, and testing IT controls. This framework has been created and adopted by the Big N audit houses as a solution to some IT audit, compliance, and control problems.` [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-cobit-in-information-security)


Moreover, COBIT provides maturity models, critical success factors, main objective indicators, and implementation indicators, administrative guidelines, etc.


There is also certifications related to this framework, which aims to showcase the IT professinal knowledge on the COBIT `foundations` and `principles`, and to bring him closer to the core of the organization and its strategic plans.

1. **COBIT 5 Foundation**
2. **COBIT 5 Implementation**
3. **COBIT 5 Assessor**


###### Note: the certification does not have a validation date and has a 50% correction for approvement.


There is a set of tasks that are inherent to the scope of IT operations, and that should be addressed with high priority:

- **Information Management**
- **IT Services Monitoring**
- **The Work Force**
- **Security**
- **Data Administration**
- **Crisis Contaiment**


Another important point about COBIT is that it does not prevent its use together with other frameworks, like the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which is more inline with tasks management inside the IT department and its operartions..


So, while thinking about the use of COBIT together with ITIL, there should be on the first  then the aim to optimize the process and stages related to IT Governance, and on the second the best practices to achieve value to the company while the IT services are put to use for the whole operation.



#### Funcionalities from COBIT 5   

1. Planning and Organizing
2. Acquirement and Organization
3. Deliver and Support
4. Monitoring and Evaluation


#### Principles from COBIT 5

1. **Meeting stakeholders needs**: since IT correlates to different parts of the administration, from strategic planning to the daily IT process, it should also meet the expectation of each involved part.
2. **Covering the enterprise end to end**: since IT process spred acress all the department and operations, it is necessary that each and all of them should account to the IT assets and their assessment to the strategic plannig.
3. **Applying a single integrated framework**: meaning that even when COBIT is used together with other frameworks, they should all be integrated to cover a broader, but single IT Governance and Management.
4. **Enabling a holistic approach**: this should imply that the effort with IT Governance and Management should involve every diverse field of the organizations:   
    4.1. Departments   
    4.2. Processes   
    4.3. Activities   
    4.4. Resources and finantial assets   
    4.5. Culture, etc.
5. **Separating governance from management**: here, there is the importance of creating some layers in the operation, and to separate each concern accordingly, from the evaluation of the quality and security of day-by-day management of processes, to the monitoring and evaluation of strategic goals and the value achieved.
