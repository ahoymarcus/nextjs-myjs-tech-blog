### Introduction
 
To try to understand these two terms that seems particularly close, in an article, [Magowan](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/governance-vs-management/) starts this topic with a generic differentiation of the two ideas:

1. **Governance**: it should be more inline with the organization and its strategic directions.
2. **Management**: it should be more inline with transposing of the organization directives into action.


And taking off from that basic division, the author then brings some clarification to the matter applying some of the definitions from Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), which is a framework for governance and management specifically tailored to IT.

So, applying some of the underling ideas from COBIT, the problem could be presented this way:

1. **Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM)**: which would cover the main governance activities, to access and evaluate the needs of the stackholders, to direct through priorization and monitoring results.
2. **Plan, Build, Run, and Monitor (PBRM)**: which would cover the main management activities, that would mean to put the government dispositions into action and to be monitored.


### IT Management

Bringing the problem even more to the center of the IT Area, it could be said that IT Management have two basic functions:

1. To set and monitor the efficiency of the information systems infrastructure.
2. To prepare and help the workers to cope better with the IT operation.


So, considering that the IT resources have to available and functional at all times, there could be said that the IT Management responsabilities should include:

- **Determining business requirements for IT systems**
- **Managing IT budgets and costs**
- **Monitoring safety and compliance**
- **Controlling system and network security**
- **Implementing new software, hardware and data systems**
- **Providing technical or help desk support**


#### The Importance of IT Management

Since in the contemporary society guided by an information economy, it should be the responsability of IT management to make this connection between the business of the organization and the informational tools it effectively needs to succed.
