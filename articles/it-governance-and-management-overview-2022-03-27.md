### Introduction
 
To try to understand these two terms that seems particularly close, in an article, [Magowan](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/governance-vs-management/) starts this topic with a generic differentiation of the two ideas:

1. **Governance**: it should be more inline with the organization and its strategic directions.
2. **Management**: it should be more inline with transposing of the organization directives into action.


And taking off from that basic division, the author then brings some clarification to the matter applying some of the definitions from Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), which is a framework for governance and management specifically tailored to IT.

So, applying some of the underling ideas from COBIT, the problem could be presented this way:

1. **Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM)**: which would cover the main governance activities, to access and evaluate the needs of the stakeholders, to direct through priorization and monitoring results.
2. **Plan, Build, Run, and Monitor (PBRM)**: which would cover the main management activities, that would mean to put the government dispositions into action and to be monitored.

### IT Government and IT Management


#### The Importance of IT Governance

**COMING SOON...**


#### The Importance of IT Management

Bringing the problem even more to the center of the IT Area, it could be said that IT Management have two basic functions:

1. To set and monitor the efficiency of the information systems infrastructure.
2. To prepare and help the workers to cope better with the IT operation.


So, considering that the IT resources have to available and functional at all times, there could be said that the IT Management responsabilities should include:

1. **Determining business requirements for IT systems**
2. **Managing IT budgets and costs**
3. **Monitoring safety and compliance**
4. **Controlling system and network security**
5. **Implementing new software, hardware and data systems**
6. **Providing technical or help desk support**


Since in the contemporary society guided by an information economy, it should be the responsability of IT management to make this connection between the business of the organization and the informational tools it effectively needs to succed.


`In turn, businesses who wish to remain competitive long-term must understand how to integrate IT services into their daily operations in a responsible and meaningful way.` [Trio.dev](https://trio.dev/blog/it-management)



### IT Strategic Planning

The idea of a strategic planning for the IT area is a concept that has been gaining strength since technology has become a important piece inside the organization of a company.


And for that, since IT today is much more than a provider of some restrict resources for business, but has become a important factor for the development of the whole operation, it also becomes important that the area of IT should update itself to adhere this new strategic role.


Some elements that should be around a IT strategic planning:

1. **To follow close the strategic business plans for the organization**
2. **To bring the IT area to correct adapt itself to the internal and external environment of the company**
3. **To correct allocate resources of infrastructure, budget, and professionals**
4. **To better understand its clients**
5. **To set directives and short, medium and long goals**
6. **To find overhead in the operation**
7. **To have a understand about the real position of the competition**


#### Advantages from IT Strategic Planning

1. o help the organization reach its strategic plans
2. Improving the positioning of the IT area in the company operation and the optimization in the use of technological resources
3. Reduction of costs and risks
4. To improve workflow
5. Brings transparency to the IT operation and help to define and monitor the priorities
6. To improve communication with the other departments of the organization
7. *Create means to measure and to analyse all the operation


#### Key Elements from the IT Strategic Planning

 1. **Mission**: it should state how the IT fits the strategic plans of the company and which should be its main efforts.
 2. **Diagnostics**: it means to have a descriptive vision of the IT area current state, both its strong poinst and short comings.   
    2.1. Its culture   
    2.2. The competition   
    2.3. The opportunities    
    2.4. The risks
3. **Priorities**: once it is clear the  main description for the IT area, it's time to define priorities, not only to tackle opportunities, but also to minimaze risks and short comings.
4. **Tactical Plan**: the should be a clear and concret paths to deal with the tasks ahead, and even in terms of short, medium, and in long term. 
5. **Roles and Responsabilities**: the roles and responsabilities should be very well known by each parson, and it also should be written and validated.
6. **Goals**: it's important that the plans and actions should have definive goals and quantified measures to define quality, just as to state the unacceptable results.
7. **Resources**: it's also very important to know that the resources are correct and sufficient to achieve each of the goals. Pehaps, to define also where to go for extra resources needed.


#### Errors in Planning

1. **Loose focus and low efficacy**: the planning has to be clear and pragmatic.    
    1.1. There should be a comprehensive calendar with timelines to be achieved.
2. **To treat the final document/plan as a mere formality**
3. **To await to the right time!**: the right time for the IT Strategic Planning should be the current time, meaning that the lack of plan is a problem, but that a existent plan has also to be put to action.
4. **A Rigid Plan**: the planning has to be flexible to be updated as to follow close potential changes, both internaly or externaly, that may change perspective over past decisions.
5. **A inbalanced plan**: the plan should be aware both of short goals, as of long goals. To miss either part of the equation could result in loss for the company. 



### COBIT

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are a set of best practices and recommendations for IT Governance to promote security and quality within the IT operations, and it was developed in the 1990s by the IT Governance Institute.


`The COBIT Framework provides a tool for the business process owner that affect the discharge of business process tasks. COBIT is an IT-centric framework designed to provide users, businesses, and auditors with a standard approach for designing, implementing, and testing IT controls. This framework has been created and adopted by the Big N audit houses as a solution to some IT audit, compliance, and control problems.` [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-cobit-in-information-security)


Moreover, COBIT provides maturity models, critical success factors, main objective indicators, and implementation indicators, administrative guidelines, etc.


There is also certifications related to this framework, which aims to showcase the IT professinal knowledge on the COBIT `foundations` and `principles`, and to bring him closer to the core of the organization and its strategic plans.

1. **COBIT 5 Foundation**
2. **COBIT 5 Implementation**
3. **COBIT 5 Assessor**


###### Note: the certification does not have a validation date and has a 50% correction for approvement.


There is a set of tasks that are inherent to the scope of IT operations, and that should be addressed with high priority:

- **Information Management**
- **IT Services Monitoring**
- **The Work Force**
- **Security**
- **Data Administration**
- **Crisis Contaiment**


Another important point about COBIT is that it does not prevent its use together with other frameworks, like the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which is more inline with tasks management inside the IT department and its operartions..


So, while thinking about the use of COBIT together with ITIL, there should be on the first  then the aim to optimize the process and stages related to IT Governance, and on the second the best practices to achieve value to the company while the IT services are put to use for the whole operation.



#### Funcionalities from COBIT 5   

1. Planning and Organizing
2. Acquirement and Organization
3. Deliver and Support
4. Monitoring and Evaluation


#### Principles from COBIT 5

1. **Meeting stakeholders needs**: since IT correlates to different parts of the administration, from strategic planning to the daily IT process, it should also meet the expectation of each involved part.
2. **Covering the enterprise end to end**: since IT process spred acress all the department and operations, it is necessary that each and all of them should account to the IT assets and their assessment to the strategic plannig.
3. **Applying a single integrated framework**: meaning that even when COBIT is used together with other frameworks, they should all be integrated to cover a broader, but single IT Governance and Management.
4. **Enabling a holistic approach**: this should imply that the effort with IT Governance and Management should involve every diverse field of the organizations:   
    4.1. Departments   
    4.2. Processes   
    4.3. Activities   
    4.4. Resources and finantial assets   
    4.5. Culture, etc.
5. **Separating governance from management**: here, there is the importance of creating some layers in the operation, and to separate each concern accordingly, from the evaluation of the quality and security of day-by-day management of processes, to the monitoring and evaluation of strategic goals and the value achieved.


#### Advantages from the COBIT Framework

1. Strategic planning and IT department alignment
2. Transparency form plans and goals
3. Quality of the service
4. Improve the value of IT operation
5. Productivity
6. Compliance 
7. Risk assessment



### ITIL

ITIL stands for Information Technology Infrastructure LIbrary, and it is a set of best practices for delivering IT services, to maximaze efficiency and bring predictability to the services provided.

According to the site [SimpliLearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/itil-key-concepts-and-summary-article), the ITIL has become the de facto standard in IT service management. So, ITIL works around any kind of organization to help them accomplish their services in a quality-driven and economical way.
 

As a framework, is discussion first came into light during the 1980s when the British government realised that they need to improve the quality of their IT services, and sent this demand to the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), now Office of Government Commerce (OGC) to elelaborate some system. [ItilTraining.com](https://www.itiltraining.com/usa/blog/itil-history)


#### Brief History of ITIL Framework

It was in **1989** that by the name of Government Information Technology Infrastrucure (GITIM) that this framework first came around and started being adopted by public agencies and private companies across Europe as a means to IT services improvement and soon grew to cover 30-volume wide catalog. 


Then, in **2000** came its version 2, which was already present in the US also, for example in the Microsoft operations. This new version aimed specially to make the framework more accessible and started to categorizing the huge 30-volume document into nine related categories.

 
In **2007** came the version 3, the one that brought a new aquired name, ITIL Refresh Project, which was also following the path to make the framework even more friendly when releasing a ITIL Glossary.
 
It was in **2011** that came a revision to the ITIL V3, and besides bringing some corrections to errors and inconsistences with V3, this revision divided again the catalog into 5 areas, reduzing the final catalog to be 5 volumes wide:

1. **ITIL Service Strategy**
2. **ITIL Service Design**
3. **ITIL Service Transition**
4. **ITIL Service Operation**
5. **ITIL Continual Service**


Then, since **2013** ITIL has been owened by AXELOS Ltd and the British Government Office.


Finally, in **2019** came its V4, which continue with the movement in terms of accessibility. In this case, the framework incorporated more practical guidances on how to use the ITIL framework, especially in collaborative environments, what in its turn open the door to the bring the framework closer to the Agile and DevOps philosophies. [ItilTraining.com](https://www.itiltraining.com/usa/blog/itil-history)
 
 
#### Basic Concepts of the ITIL Framework

1. Delivering maximum value to customers
2. Optimizing resources and capabilities
3. Offering services that are useful and reliable
4. Planning processes with specifid golas in mind
5. Defining roles clearly for each task
 
 
There are also some key ITIL terms:
 
1. **Capabilities**: the specialized skills or abilities an organization applies to resources to create value.
2. **Processes**: these are the structured set of activities which aim for specific goal. Its characteristics:    
    2.1. Transform inputs into outputs.   
    2.2. Deliver results to a specific customer or stakeholder.   
    2.3. They are measurable.   
    2.4. They are triggered by specifc events.
3. **Functions**: these are self-contained processes with specific aims, that usually take the form of a group set and their working tools.
4. **Resources**: the raw materials that are transformed.
5. **Roles**: these a sets of responsabilities and priviledges, and may be held by individuals or groups.
6. **Service Assets**: these are the features in a service.   
7. **Service Management**: a proper analysis and evaluation of the services provided.
8. **Services**: these are the values delivered to the customers.
9. **Value, Utility, and Warranty**: the value is the benefit generated by the service provided. The value is tracked by ITIL in terms of Utility and Warranty:  
    9.1. Utility: also called the fitness for purpose.   
    9.2. Warranty: also called the fitness for use, or in other terms, its reliability.
 
 
#### Basic Structure of the ITIL Framework 
 
As it was said above about the revision made to V3 in **2011**, the ITIL catalog was divided into 5 areas:

### Indicators Methodologies
 
Just as the frameworks concerning governance and management that exist in the market, there are also smaller frameworks and specialized frameworks to deal with indicators and measurement tools.

Two of these indicators are **KPI** and **OKR**, and eventhough sometimes the may overlap each other in some aspects, they should be treated as different and specific tools. And there are also many others indicators, like **BSC**, etc.


#### KPI Indicator

This is the acronym for Key Performance Indicator (KPI), and it is `used to evaluate performance over time for an organization, individual, program, project, action, etc.` [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)


And in the article linked above, the author sees 3 specific indicators that may vary a little bit and be some what confused with the concepts measured by other tools, like OKR, for exemple:

1. **Link to strategic objectives**
2. **Direct where to focus resources**
3. **Be measured against targets**


###### Some notes on KPI Indicators: 
1. This indicator should always be designed in a quantative nature, because as it is taught by some, it makes easier to provide context and for comparing performace.
2. They should be specific (not vague), and should have context and meaning for each KPI.
3. They must me **Key features** or indicators from strategic level.


- Some exemples of the use KPI indicators [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/):
- **Retail Industry**: revenue per square foot, same-store sales, sales per employee.
- **HR Department**: attrition rate, employee performance, average recruitment time.
- **Sales Department**: customer lifetime value, sales revenue, calls made.
- **Technology Industry**: monthly recurring revenue, customer retention or churn, ticket resolution time.
- **Healthcare Industry**: patient wait time, average treatment charge, number of educational programs.


#### OKR Indicator
 
On the other hand, OKR is the acronym for Objective and Key Results, or more specifically `an objective is tied to key results. OKR is a strategic framework, whereas KPIs are measurements that exist witin a framework`. [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)
 

The same article also states that OKR has a more simplistic fashion as a framework, which groups a limited number of high-level objectives to some, also a limited number of key results per objective.


Some characteristics a OKR should have:

1. **Always quantifiable**
2. **Able to be objectively scored on a 0-1 or 0-100 scale**
3. **Timelined**
4. **Ambitious**: the objectives and the results should be some what hard to reach or some distinctive in that nature.


- Some exemples of the use OKR indicators [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/):
1. Objective: Become the market leader in our industry.     
    1.1. Key result #1: record $100 million in revenue.   
    1.2. Key result #2: increase staff by 45 percent.   
    1.3. Key result #3: increase market cap suffieciently to enter S&P 500.
2. Objective: Develop autonomous vehicles.   
    2.1. Key result #1: hire 10 artificial intelligence subject matter experts.   
    2.2. Key result #2: invest an additional $500 million in research and development.   
    2.3. Key result #3: roll out prototype by fiscal year-end.
3. Objective: Increase revenue by 30 percent.   
    3.1. Key result #1: acquire 50 new customers.   
    3.2. Key result #2: increase marketing leads by 20 percent.   
    3.3. Key resutl #3: increase customer retention to 85 percent.


###### Some notes on OKR Indicators: 
1. They must have alignment with the rest of the orginization, especially beign created from top down in the company structure.
2. These indicators are better fitted for strategic impruvements, so they are not the best fit for focusing on mainataining the pace of processes.
 
 
#### BSC Indicator
 
Balance Score Card (BSC) is a strategic planning and management system, and it is use with the aim of:

- **Communicate goals to be accomplished**
- **Align the day-to-day work with the organization strategy**
- **Prioritizing projects, products, and services**
- **Measure and monitor progress toward strategic targets**


According to the [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/), the concept of the name 'Balance Scorecard' comes from the idea of a more balanced approach to strategically measuring organizations or processes besides the limited traditional financial measurements.


`The concept of balanced scorecard has evolved beyond the simple use of perspectives and it is now a holistic system for managing strategy. A key benefit of using a disciplined framework is that it gives organizations a way to ‚Äúconnect the dots‚Äù between the various components of strategic planning and management, meaning that there will be a visible connection between the projects and programs that people are working on, the measurements being used to track success (KPIs), the strategic objectives the organization is trying to accomplish, and the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization.`  [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/)
 
 
And according to a article from [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard), this same concept from Kaplan & Norton with the BSC idea became a foundational principle in the evaluation of Governance, business strategy, and management performance, for short, medium, and also long term. 


`The inference was that organizations could enhance their creation of value and enterprise performance by improving the management of their non-financial, intangible assets, through the integration of these into their existing performance management systems. As the saying goes, if you can‚Äôt measure it, you can‚Äôt improve it‚Ä¶ so in retrospect it seemed inevitable that non-financial measures would emerge as critical to the overall performance management of the enterprise.` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)
 
 
And the BSC concept also suggets that an organization should be examined from four different perspectives:

1. **Financial (or Stewardship)**: measure an organization's financial performance and also its use of the resources finantially.
2. **Customer/Stakeholder**: it focuses on performance from the point of view of customers or from the point of view of stakeholders.
3. **Internal Process**: this measure is focused on the quality and efficiency of processes and products, or other key business factor.
4. **Organization Capacity (or Learning & Growth)**: this last area has the focus on the different kinds of capital and values from the organization:   
    4.1. Human capital  
    4.2. Infrastructure   
    4.3. Technology  
    4.4. Culture    
    4.5. Any other capacity that may bring breakthrough performance.


###### BSC and COBIT 5

So, for [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard), it became no surprise that a framework that has widen the scope of governance beyond the mere financial view, but to also include intangible assets would merge perfectly into the COBIT 5 environment.
 

Another interesting point underlined from the above site, though, it is the fact that the BSC and COBIT 5 especially fit into a cohese system concerning the point of **The stakeholders** which cascades down to the more specific areas. 
 
`The BSC provides for a balanced, holistic view of the Enterprise, and by using the BSC as a common tool to represent and align Enterprise and IT goals, COBIT 5 has provided an essential snapshot of the total value delivery of Enterprise IT to the organization.` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)
