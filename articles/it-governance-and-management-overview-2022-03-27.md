### Introduction
 
To try to understand these two terms that seems particularly close, in an article, [Magowan](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/governance-vs-management/) starts this topic with a generic differentiation of the two ideas:

1. **Governance**: it should be more inline with the organization and its strategic directions.
2. **Management**: it should be more inline with transposing of the organization directives into action.


And taking off from that basic division, the author then brings some clarification to the matter applying some of the definitions from Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), which is a framework for governance and management specifically tailored to IT.

So, applying some of the underling ideas from COBIT, the problem could be presented this way:

1. **Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM)**: which would cover the main governance activities, to access and evaluate the needs of the stackholders, to direct through priorization and monitoring results.
2. **Plan, Build, Run, and Monitor (PBRM)**: which would cover the main management activities, that would mean to put the government dispositions into action and to be monitored.



### IT Government and IT Management


#### The Importance of IT Governance

**COMING SOON...**


#### The Importance of IT Management

Bringing the problem even more to the center of the IT Area, it could be said that IT Management have two basic functions:

1. To set and monitor the efficiency of the information systems infrastructure.
2. To prepare and help the workers to cope better with the IT operation.


So, considering that the IT resources have to available and functional at all times, there could be said that the IT Management responsabilities should include:

1. **Determining business requirements for IT systems**
2. **Managing IT budgets and costs**
3. **Monitoring safety and compliance**
4. **Controlling system and network security**
5. **Implementing new software, hardware and data systems**
6. **Providing technical or help desk support**


Since in the contemporary society guided by an information economy, it should be the responsability of IT management to make this connection between the business of the organization and the informational tools it effectively needs to succed.


`In turn, businesses who wish to remain competitive long-term must understand how to integrate IT services into their daily operations in a responsible and meaningful way.` [Trio.dev](https://trio.dev/blog/it-management)



### IT Strategic Planning

The idea of a strategic planning for the IT area is a concept that has been gaining strength since technology has become a important piece inside the organization of a company.


And for that, since IT today is much more than a provider of some restrict resources for business, but has become a important factor for the development of the whole operation, it also becomes important that the area of IT should update itself to adhere this new strategic role.


Some elements that should be around a IT strategic planning:

1. **To follow close the strategic business plans for the organization**
2. **To bring the IT area to correct adapt itself to the internal and external environment of the company**
3. **To correct allocate resources of infrastructure, budget, and professionals**
4. **To better understand its clients**
5. **To set directives and short, medium and long goals**
6. **To find overhead in the operation**
7. **To have a understand about the real position of the competition**


#### Advantages from IT Strategic Planning

1. o help the organization reach its strategic plans
2. Improving the positioning of the IT area in the company operation and the optimization in the use of technological resources
3. Reduction of costs and risks
4. To improve workflow
5. Brings transparency to the IT operation and help to define and monitor the priorities
6. To improve communication with the other departments of the organization
7. *Create means to measure and to analyse all the operation


#### Key Elements from the IT Strategic Planning

 1. **Mission**: it should state how the IT fits the strategic plans of the company and which should be its main efforts.
 2. **Diagnostics**: it means to have a descriptive vision of the IT area current state, both its strong poinst and short comings.   
    2.1. Its culture   
    2.2. The competition   
    2.3. The opportunities    
    2.4. The risks
3. **Priorities**: once it is clear the  main description for the IT area, it's time to define priorities, not only to tackle opportunities, but also to minimaze risks and short comings.
4. **Tactical Plan**: the should be a clear and concret paths to deal with the tasks ahead, and even in terms of short, medium, and in long term. 
5. **Roles and Responsabilities**: the roles and responsabilities should be very well known by each parson, and it also should be written and validated.
6. **Goals**: it's important that the plans and actions should have definive goals and quantified measures to define quality, just as to state the unacceptable results.
7. **Resources**: it's also very important to know that the resources are correct and sufficient to achieve each of the goals. Pehaps, to define also where to go for extra resources needed.


#### Errors in Planning

1. **Loose focus and low efficacy**: the planning has to be clear and pragmatic.    
    1.1. There should be a comprehensive calendar with timelines to be achieved.
2. **To treat the final document/plan as a mere formality**
3. **To await to the right time!**: the right time for the IT Strategic Planning should be the current time, meaning that the lack of plan is a problem, but that a existent plan has also to be put to action.
4. **A Rigid Plan**: the planning has to be flexible to be updated as to follow close potential changes, both internaly or externaly, that may change perspective over past decisions.
5. **A inbalanced plan**: the plan should be aware both of short goals, as of long goals. To miss either part of the equation could result in loss for the company. 



### COBIT

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are a set of best practices and recommendations for IT Governance to promote security and quality within the IT operations.


There is also certifications related to this framework, which aims to showcase the IT professinal knowledge on the COBIT `foundations` and `principles`, and to bring him closer to the core of the organization and its strategic plans.

1. **COBIT 5 Foundation**
2. **COBIT 5 Implementation**
3. **COBIT 5 Assessor**


###### Note: the certification does not have a validation date and has a 50% correction for approvement.


There is a set tasks that are inherent to the scope of IT operations, and that should be addressed with high priority:

- **Information Management**
- **IT Services Monitoring**
- **The Work Force**
- **Security**
- **Data Administration**
- **Crisis Contaiment**


Another important point about COBIT is that it does not prevent its use together with other frameworks, like the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which is more inline with tasks management inside the IT department and its operartions..


So, while thinking about the use of COBIT together with ITIL, there should be on the first  then the aim to optimize the process and stages related to IT Governance, and on the second the best practices to achieve value to the company while the IT services are put to use for the whole operation.



#### Funcionalities from COBIT 5   

1. Planning and Organizing
2. Acquirement and Organization
3. Deliver and Support
4. Monitoring and Evaluation


#### Principles from COBIT 5

1. **Meeting stakeholders needs**: since IT correlates to different parts of the administration, from strategic planning to the daily IT process, it should also meet the expectation of each involved part.
2. Covering the enterprise end to end: since IT process spred acress all the department and operations, it is necessary that each and all of them should account to the IT assets and their assessment to the strategic plannig.
3. Applying a single integrated framework: meaning that even when COBIT is used together with other frameworks, they should all be integrated to cover a broader, but single IT Governance and Management.
4. Enabling a holistic approach: this should imply that the effort with IT Governance and Management should involve every diverse field of the organizations:   
    4.1. Departments   
    4.2. Processes   
    4.3. Activities   
    4.4. Resources and finantial assets   
    4.5. Culture, etc.
5. Separating governance from management: here, there is the importance of creating some layers in the operation, and to separate each concern accordingly, from the evaluation of the quality and security of day-by-day management of processes, to the monitoring and evaluation of strategic goals and the value achieved.


#### Advantages from the COBIT Framework

1. Strategic planning and IT department alignment
2. Transparency form plans and goals
3. Quality of the service
4. Improve the value of IT operation
5. Productivity
6. Compliance 
7. Risk assessment
