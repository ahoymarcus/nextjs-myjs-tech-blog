### Introduction
 
Talking about IT Governance and IT Management may sound a bit confusing to differenciate at first, but to improve into the understand of these two terms that appears particularly close at first sight, Kirstie Magowan starts this topic with a generic differentiation of the two ideas in the article, [IT Governance vs IT Management: Mastering the Differences](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/governance-vs-management/):

1. **Governance**: it should be more inline with the organization and its strategic directions.
2. **Management**: it should be more inline with transposition of the organization directives into action.


And, thus, taking off from that basic division, the author brings some extra clarification to the matter by applying some of the definitions from the **COBIT framework (Control Objectives for Information Technology)** itself, which is a framework for governance and management specifically tailored to IT.


So, while bringing some of the underling ideas from the **COBIT** framework, the problem could be presented this way:

1. **Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM)**: which would cover the main governance activities, to access and evaluate the needs of the stakeholders, to direct through priorization and monitoring results.
2. **Plan, Build, Run, and Monitor (PBRM)**: which would cover the main management activities, that would mean to put the government dispositions into action and to be monitored.

### IT Government and IT Management

#### The Importance of IT Governance

Since that this contemporary society seems to be guided by a kind of **"informative economy"**, it should be the actual responsability of IT management to make this connection between the business of the organization and the informational tools it effectively needs to succed.


`"In turn, businesses who wish to remain competitive long-term must understand how to integrate IT services into their daily operations in a responsible and meaningful way."` [Trio.dev](https://trio.dev/blog/it-management)


The idea of a strategic planning for the IT area is a concept that has been gaining strength since technology has become a important piece inside the organization of a company.


And for that, since IT today is much more than a provider of some restrict resources for business, but has become a important factor for the development of the whole operation, it also becomes important that the area of IT should update itself to adhere this new strategic role.


Some elements that should be around a IT strategic planning:

1. **To follow close the strategic business plans for the organization**
2. **To bring the IT area to correct adapt itself to the internal and external environment of the company**
3. **To correct allocate resources of infrastructure, budget, and professionals**
4. **To better understand its clients**
5. **To set directives and short, medium and long goals**
6. **To find overhead in the operation**
7. **To have a understand about the real position of the competition**



#### The Importance of IT Management

Now, for IT Management, the focus should be brought even even more into the center of the IT Area as it could be said that IT Management was supposed to have two basic functions:

1. To set and monitor the efficiency of the information systems infrastructure.
2. To prepare and help the workers to cope better with the IT operation.


Then, considering that the IT resources have to be available and functional at all times, there should be said that the IT Management responsabilities have to include:

1. **Determining business requirements for IT systems**
2. **Managing IT budgets and costs**
3. **Monitoring safety and compliance**
4. **Controlling system and network security**
5. **Implementing new software, hardware and data systems**
6. **Providing technical or help desk support**



### IT Strategic Planning

#### Advantages from IT Strategic Planning

So, as it was stated before about the importance of implementing IT Governance, the task of performing a Strategic Planning is essential to allow the IT area adhere its operations to the business model and strategy:

1. To help the organization reach its strategic plans
2. Improving the positioning of the IT area in the company operation and the optimization in the use of technological resources
3. Reduction of costs and risks
4. To improve workflow
5. Brings transparency to the IT operation and help to define and monitor the priorities
6. To improve communication with the other departments of the organization
7. To create means to measure and to analyse all the operation


#### Key Elements from the IT Strategic Planning

1. **Mission**: it should state how the IT fits the strategic plans of the company and which should be its main efforts.
2. **Diagnostics**: it means to have a descriptive vision of the IT area current state, both its strong poinst and short comings:   
    2.1. Its culture   
    2.2. The competition   
    2.3. The opportunities    
    2.4. The risks
3. **Priorities**: once it is clear the  main description for the IT area, it should be time to define what had to be IT's real priorities, that is, to tackle the best opportunities for its devised mission, and also to minimaze risks and its short comings.
4. **Tactical Plan**: then, together with those set of priorities, there should be clear and concret paths to deal with each of the tasks ahead and priorities ahead.   
  4.1. There should be also **landmarks** to stress the terms of the **short**, the **medium**, and in the **long** term commitments presented by this Strategic Plan itself. 
5. **Roles and Responsabilities**: the roles and responsabilities should be very well known by each person.   5.1. Besides making the ownership for each strategic role and responsability to individual members of the staff, they should also be written down and validated as well.
6. **Goals**: it's important that the plans and actions should have **definive goals** and **quantified measures** to define quality, just as to state the unacceptable results.
7. **Resources**: it's also very important to know that the resources are correct and sufficient to achieve each of the goals.  
  7.1. And pehaps, besides this verificaion about the actual resourses, there should be planned also the means for extra resources in case it is needed.




#### Errors in Planning

1. **Loose focus and low efficacy**: the planning has to be clear and pragmatic:      
    1.1. There should be a comprehensive calendar with timelines to be achieved.
2. **To treat the final document/plan as a mere formality**
3. **To await to the right time!**: the right time for the IT Strategic Planning should be the current time, meaning that the lack of plan is a problem, but that a existent plan has also to be put to action.
4. **A Rigid Plan**: the planning has to be flexible to be updated as to follow close potential changes, both internaly or externaly, that may change perspective over past decisions.
5. **A inbalanced plan**: the plan should be aware both of short goals, as of long goals. To miss either part of the equation could result in losses for the company. 




### Kinds of Methodology Indicators 
 
Just as the frameworks concerning governance and management that exist in the market, there are also smaller frameworks and specialized frameworks to deal with indicators and measurement tools.


Two of these indicators are **KPI** and **OKR**, and eventhough sometimes they may overlap each other in some aspects, they should be treated as different and specific tools. And there are still others indicators, like **BSC**, for example.



#### KPI Indicator

This is the acronym for **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**, and it is `"used to evaluate performance over time for an organization, individual, program, project, action, etc."` [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)


And in the article linked above, the author, Angel Oh, observes 3 specific indicators that can vary a little bit and that can also be some what confused with concepts measured by some other tools, like the **OKR** framework, because **KPI** is a concrete mesurement used within frameworks, while **OKR** is a complete strategic framework by itself.


So, for the part of **KPI** measurements, Angel Oh points out these indicators:

1. **Link to strategic objectives**
2. **Direct where to focus resources**
3. **Be measured against targets**




###### Some notes on **KPI** Indicators: 
1. This indicator should always be designed in a quantative nature, because as it is taught by some, it makes not only easier to provide context to it, but also for comparing its performace.
2. They should be specific (not vague), and should have context and meaning for each KPI.
3. They must be **Key features** or key indicators from strategic level.


- Some exemples of the use **KPI** indicators [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/):
- **Retail Industry**: revenue per square foot, same-store sales, sales per employee.
- **HR Department**: attrition rate, employee performance, average recruitment time.
- **Sales Department**: customer lifetime value, sales revenue, calls made.
- **Technology Industry**: monthly recurring revenue, customer retention or churn, ticket resolution time.
- **Healthcare Industry**: patient wait time, average treatment charge, number of educational programs.




#### OKR Indicator
 
On the other hand, for the **OKR** framework which come from the acronym for **Objective and Key Results**, it is important to remember, as it was sais above, that it is `"an objective is tied to key results. OKR is a strategic framework, whereas KPIs are measurements that exist within a framework"`. [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/)
 

Also in that same article, it explains that **OKR** has a more simplistic fashion as a framework, which groups a limited number of high-level objectives to some, also a limited number of key results per objective.


Some characteristics a **OKR** should have:

1. **Always quantifiable**
2. **To be able to be objectively scored on a 0-1 or 0-100 scale**
3. **Timelined**
4. **Ambitious**: the objectives and the results should be some what hard to reach or have some distinctive distinction in that nature.


- Some exemples of the use **OKR** indicators [ClearPointStrategy.com](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/okrs-vs-kpis/):
1. Objective: Become the market leader in our industry.     
    1.1. Key result #1: record $100 million in revenue.   
    1.2. Key result #2: increase staff by 45 percent.   
    1.3. Key result #3: increase market cap suffieciently to enter S&P 500.
2. Objective: Develop autonomous vehicles.   
    2.1. Key result #1: hire 10 artificial intelligence subject matter experts.   
    2.2. Key result #2: invest an additional $500 million in research and development.   
    2.3. Key result #3: roll out prototype by fiscal year-end.
3. Objective: Increase revenue by 30 percent.   
    3.1. Key result #1: acquire 50 new customers.   
    3.2. Key result #2: increase marketing leads by 20 percent.   
    3.3. Key resutl #3: increase customer retention to 85 percent.



###### Some notes on **OKR** Indicators: 
1. They must have alignment with the rest of the orginization, especially beign created from top down in the company structure.
2. These indicators are better fitted for strategic improvements, so they are not the best fit for focusing on maintaining the pace of processes.



 
#### BSC Indicator
 
**Balance Score Card (BSC)** is a strategic planning and management system, and it is used with the aim of:

- **Communicate goals to be accomplished**
- **Align the day-to-day work with the organization strategy**
- **Prioritizing projects, products, and services**
- **Measure and monitor progress toward strategic targets**


According to the [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/), the concept of the name 'Balance Scorecard' comes from the idea of a more balanced approach to strategically measuring organizations or processes besides the limited traditional financial measurements.


`"The concept of balanced scorecard has evolved beyond the simple use of perspectives and it is now a holistic system for managing strategy. A key benefit of using a disciplined framework is that it gives organizations a way to “connect the dots” between the various components of strategic planning and management, meaning that there will be a visible connection between the projects and programs that people are working on, the measurements being used to track success (KPIs), the strategic objectives the organization is trying to accomplish, and the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization."`  [Balance Score Card Institute](https://balancedscorecard.org/bsc-basics-overview/)
 
 
And this same view is present also in this article from [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard), where the idea of extending the traditional view of contemplating the business performance beyond the mere regards of short term financial metrics, that were brought forth by Kaplan & Norton into their new system, the "Balanced Scorecard (BSC)".


So, in this new conception, it became adamant with the **BSC** principles to extend the evaluatinon of the business to add also non-financial measures and  incorporating intangible assets also, all within the new context of applying busuness governance, business strategy, and management the operations performance, not only for short, but also for medium, and long term:


`"The inference was that organizations could enhance their creation of value and enterprise performance by improving the management of their non-financial, intangible assets, through the integration of these into their existing performance management systems. As the saying goes, if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it… so in retrospect it seemed inevitable that non-financial measures would emerge as critical to the overall performance management of the enterprise."` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)
 
 
And the **BSC** concept also suggets that an organization should be examined from four different perspectives:
1. **Financial (or Stewardship)**: measure an organization's financial performance and also its use of the resources financially.
2. **Customer/Stakeholder**: it focuses on performance from the point of view of customers or from the point of view of stakeholders.
3. **Internal Process**: this measure is focused on the quality and efficiency of processes and products, or some other key business factors.
4. **Organization Capacity (or Learning & Growth)**: this last area has the focus on the different kinds of capital and values from the organization:   
    4.1. Human capital  
    4.2. Infrastructure   
    4.3. Technology  
    4.4. Culture    
    4.5. Any other capacity that may bring breakthrough performance.




###### BSC and COBIT 5

So, the article from [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard) also states that there were no surprise that such a framework that had gain so widen scope for governance going beyond the mere financial view, could also be including another important intangible assets, that is that it would merge perfectly into the COBIT 5 environment.
 

Another interesting point underlined from the above article was the fact that the **BSC** and **COBIT 5** are especially fited into a cohesive system that applies concerns to the point of view of the **stakeholders**, which in itself cascades down to the more specific areas of the business: 
 
`"The BSC provides for a balanced, holistic view of the Enterprise, and by using the BSC as a common tool to represent and align Enterprise and IT goals, COBIT 5 has provided an essential snapshot of the total value delivery of Enterprise IT to the organization."` [OrbusSoftware](https://www.orbussoftware.com/resources/blog/article/cobit-5-and-the-balanced-scorecard)





### Kinds of Management Tools

#### SWOT Analysis   

The acronym **SWOT** stads for **Strenghs, Weakeness, Opportunities, and Threats**, which are all attributes for analysis and are divided into 2 categories:

1. **Internal factors**:  
    1.1. Strenghts: they can be any kind of resource, either tangible or intangible, that the organization have.   
    1.2. Weakeness
2. **External factors**:   
    2.1. Opportunities   
    2.2. Threats


According to the site [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/swot-analysis.htm), the **SWOT** Analysis is the most renowned tool for audit and analysis, where in its use for analysis it becomes a key element for governance to identify and define strategies for the business model.
    

So, in its form, the tool aims to help evaluating the internal potentials and limitations of a organization, service or process, and also to find and measure opportunities and threats externally.

###### Advantages of SWOT Analysis

It is a simple methodology that can be used in vasts areas and operations, but it is also a subjective tool, and that is why the [Management Study Guide](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/swot-analysis.htm) states that, this tool is in its `best when used as a guide, and not as a prescription`:

1. It's a source of information for strategic planning.
2. Builds organization's strengths.
3. Reverse its weakneness.
4. Maximaze its response to opportunities.
5. Overcome organizations's threats.
6. It helps in identifying core competencies of the firm.
7. I helps in setting of objectives for strategic planning.



###### Limitations of SWOT Analysis

There are 2 basic limitations for this tool:

1. **Subjectivity**: as it was said, there is a great part of subjective as to define all these categories within the tool.
2. **Lack of depth**: its simplistic elements to create definition and categorization may cause inconsistances while defining strategic plans.






#### RACI Matrix

According to the site [SoftwareAdvice.com](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/what-is-a-raci-chart/), the **RACI Matrix**, also called **RACI Chart** or **RACI Model**, is a diagram that identifies the key roles and responsabilities of users against major tasks within a project, while it also servers as visual representation of the functional role played by each person on a project team.


The **RACI** acronym stands for **Responsible**, **Accountable**, **Consulted**, and **Informed**, all of which defines attributes for the roles and levels of involvement of each professional within a project:


Moreover, the site also gives a `"PRO TIP"`, explaining that within this tool, responsabilities should better be definied in individual terms `as to avoid confusion and slow decision-making`. [SoftwareAdvice.com](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/what-is-a-raci-chart/)


And, this other article from CIO, also makes the same clear remark about the importance of managing carefully the roles and responsabilities for each of the projects in a organization:

`"Having managed and rescued dozens of projects, and helped others do so, I’ve noted that there is always one critical success factor (CSF) that has either been effectively addressed or missed/messed up: clarity around the roles and responsibilities for each project participant and key stakeholder. No matter how detailed and complete a project plan may be for any project, confusion or omission of participant roles and responsibilities will cause major problems."` [Cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/287088/project-management-how-to-design-a-successful-raci-project-plan.html)



So, returning to the four basic points of analysis for this managing tool, we have that:

1. **Responsible**: this attribute refers to a person directly related to work in a task/process at hand.  
    1.1. But see that this attribute does not imply that should not be other persons around which could also responsible for that same task/process to be made.
2. **Accountable**: on the other hand, this one is a exclusive attribute which imparts to the ownership over some task or process; thus, giving to one person sole ownership to a task/process.   
    2.1. In this manner, then, this person will attain the sole voice to give account about it.
3. **Consulted**: these are people or stakeholders who need to give their input before any work can be done or sign-off.
4. **Informed**: again, these are people or stakeholder who need to be kept informed about any progress in relation to the task/process.   
    4.1. Although they do not contribute directly to the task/process.


The site also cite a quotation from Gartner where it states the importance of clearly defining all the related authority and responsabilities for each endeavour that aims to be successful. 


And that same site also makes another interesting distinction when it adverts that the RACI Chart diagram does not replace any methodology for planning and managing, but it gives important help to all that same management processes in setting responsabilities visually and in simple terms.




###### Steps to Create a RACI Matrix

The site [Cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/287088/project-management-how-to-design-a-successful-raci-project-plan.html) also gives a interesting example on how to build a RACI diagram:

1. Indentify all taks involved in delivering the project and list them along the left site of the chart.
2. Identify all the project stakeholders and list then along the top of the chart.
3. Complete the cells of the model identifying that 4 fold responsabilities already mentioned.
4. Ensure that every task has to have one stakeholder to account for it.
5. Complete the aggrement among all parts in relation to what has been defined and documented in the tool's diagram.

![raci-matrix-example-01](/images/articles/development/raci-matrix-example-01.png)




###### RACI Matrix Best Practices

1. **Don't get too granular**: the RACI matrix is not the project plan, it is solely a visual tool to give agility into responsabilities.
2. **Too much reusability of the diagram**: though a good diagram can be reused eventually, but considering the specific context of each task/project, this should be done with care and understanding.
3. **Lack of consistency**: the roles defined on the diagram must reflect the real representation of the the work to be done in a task/project. There can be no arbitrary replaciments involved.
4. **Adding too many columns**: the diagram should be clear and simple, adding only key tasks.   
    4.1. So, do not add administrative tasks, like team meetings, for example.
5. **Mixing up the persons who is responsible, and person who should be accountable for**: the person designated as 'responsible' for some task should not be also 'accountable' for that same task.   
    5.1. Besides, this same caution into adding a separation between the ownership and the participation within a process/task serves also to bring a layer of compliance to the tool. 
6. **Too many assignments given to one stakeholder**: this can lead to performance issues.
7. **There can be no empty cells left behind**: since the tool aims to bring key tasks, there should not be important element unsigned in terms of responsabilities in the task/project document.
8. **Clear aggrements**: there should be clear aggrement about the responsabilities taken in the document.





### Project Management Office (PMO)

The **Project Management Office (PMO)** is a new feature in governance and management that aims to be a link or bridge in an organization between the strategic departments and the production departments responsible for projects/services. 


It brings effort to create a professional structure that can manage and monitor projects and tasks, and even devise standardization or applying tools and methods to support the production teams, while stays connceted to the strategic demands from the stakeholder.


As the site [Bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/pmo-project-management-office/) states, there has been a shift in the way some departments offer services as development projects, since Agile methods have been taking over and directing many of its practices.


So, some of the results from this change is that the working teams are less focused on the top-down hierarchy of the company and more aligned with its own responsabilities:
1. **Focus on the aspect of the product they're working on**
2. **Continously development of the services and products: making decisions and increasing the whole experience.**


The problem with this new set is that it can result in some form of gap between the production from services/products and the business strategy:

`"Some DevOps teams lose focus on the consumer’s needs and the company’s resources and focus entirely on releasing new features whether they’re necessary or not. Not all businesses seemed ideal for the application of Agile practices, especially without adding modifications such as standardized procedures. Establishing a core set of best practices and standards for all projects throughout the organization was a key for these companies to ensure everyone could maintain the newly expected pace while still delivering quality results."`  [Bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/pmo-project-management-office/)


So, it is in this sense that a **PMO team or deparment** can be valuable for uniting both the efforts from production and from management, where the PMO can make this two set of works:
1. **To represent stakeholders and keep the effectiveness of the business model and its strategies.**
2. **Help the effort of productions teams to complete projects and also to monitor the effectiveness of the projects procedures that were outlined.**


The site [ProjectBuilder.com](https://www.projectbuilder.com.br/blog/project-management-office-tudo-o-que-voce-precisa-saber/) brings another important tasks that the PMO can use to improve management:
1. **To consolidate documents and best practices across the organization**: this can be especially providential when a organization has a diverse group of production and also has changes within its personal.
2. **Support and brace up project managers**: not only in the context of the group led by the project manager, but also across other groups inside the organization that can collaborate and share resources.


Besides, the same site above, [ProjectBuilder.com](https://www.projectbuilder.com.br/blog/project-management-office-tudo-o-que-voce-precisa-saber/) also brings some numbers about the problem related to projects completion. For that, the site cites two reports:
1. **68% of projects does not reach the goals from timeframe, costs, or scope**: from CHAOS Standish, from 2009.
2. **From 1524 organizations, innadequate plannings and evaluations are responsible for 30% of the project failures**: and the second from a research from [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/ceosurvey).





#### Primary Functions from a PMO

1. **Project management delivery**
2. **Schedule, costs and scope management**
3. **Communication**
4. **Resources management**
5. **Projects integration**
6. **Risk management**
7. **Monitoring patterns, methodologies and processes**
8. **Metodology definition**
9. **Processes improvement**
10. **Definition of metrics**
11. **Governance and performance management**
12. **Performance reports**
13. **Sharing information**





#### Basic Types of a PMO

1. **Corporative or centralized PMO**: this type is closer to the governance of the organization, and its responsabilities are more inline with bringing strategic value to the organization.   
    1.1. This kind is not the the more prevalent PMO to be found at the organizations.
2. **Delivery PMO**: the PMO is closer to the tactical execution of the projects, bringing support and monitioring to the teams to achieve the business expectations.    
    2.1. This are the most common type.
3. **Complience PMO**: they are usually related to organizations where there are speciffic processes necessary because regulartory reasons.
4. **Controlling PMO**: it is a kind of PMO that asserts a bit more of its presence among the teams and can make use of audits. 
5. **Directive PMO**: this one is the most enforcing kind there is, where comes from its responsability many, and even most, of the directives demanded from the teams.

### COBIT

#### Basic Concepts from the COBIT Framework

The **COBIT** framework or the **Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology** which is a framework devised as a set of best practices and recommendations for IT Governance, and to promote security and quality within the IT operations, and it was developed in the 1990s by ISACA (Information Systems Audit & Control Association) and IT Governance Institute.


`"The COBIT Framework provides a tool for the business process owner that affect the discharge of business process tasks. COBIT is an IT-centric framework designed to provide users, businesses, and auditors with a standard approach for designing, implementing, and testing IT controls. This framework has been created and adopted by the Big N audit houses as a solution to some IT audit, compliance, and control problems."` [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-cobit-in-information-security)


Moreover, **COBIT**, as a framework, also provides:
1. **Maturity models**,
2. **Critical success factors**,
3. **Main objective indicators**, and
4. **Implementation of indicators and administrative guidelines**, etc.


The COBIT framework may also provide many sets of certifications, which aims to showcase the IT professinal knowledge on the COBIT `foundations` and `principles`, and to bring it closer to the core of the organization and its strategic plans:
- **COBIT 5 Foundation**
- **COBIT 5 Implementation**
- **COBIT 5 Assessor**

- _**Note**_:
- The certification does not have a revalidation date and has a 50% correction for approvement.


There is also a set of tasks that are inherent to the scope of IT operations, and that should be addressed with high priority:

1. **Information Management**
2. **IT Services Monitoring**
3. **The Work Force**
4. **Security**
5. **Data Administration**
6. **Crisis Contaiment**


Another important point about COBIT is that it does not prevent its use together with other frameworks, like the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which is more inline with tasks management inside the IT department and its operartions.


So, when thinking about the compound use of **COBIT together with ITIL**, there should be a specific focus on processes and stages related to IT Governance by the first, and there should be a specific focus on IT services put to the use for the whole operation by the second one, where with both there should be a aim of optimizing best practices to achieve the most value to the whole organization.


From the ISACAS's overview paper, `COBIT 5 ISACA’s new framework for IT Governance, Risk, Security and Auditing An overview`, we learn that in its evolution the **COBIT framework** has been shifting its focus to reach a more holistic view of the enterprise at each of its steps:

![COBIT framework evolution](/images/articles/security/cobit-framework-evolution-graph.png)
- `COBIT 5 ISACA’s new framework for IT Governance, Risk, Security and Auditing An overview`. (p. 4)


So, as we can see, starting in 1996 with a **audit** orientation at its first version, the COBIT framework has passed through stages of **Control**, **Management**, **IT Governance**, between its versions 2, 3 and 4. And finally reaching a **Governance of Enterprise IT** view in its last scope as COBIT 5, in 2012.


So, in this current version of the framework that aims to provide end-to-end **information value** to businesses, because as it is stated at that same overview paper, it can improve the use of that information as:
1. **Information is a key resource for all enterprises**
2. **Information is created, use, retained, disclesed and destroyed**
3. **Technology plays a key role in these actions**
4. **Technology is becoming pervasive in all aspects of business and personal life**


And thus, by providing proper sound information, the framework can help with **some of the struggles** that enterprises and executives strive to achieve:
1. Maintain quality and soundness of information to support business decisions.
2. Generate value from IT-enabled investiment.
3. Achieve operational excellence.
4. Maintain IT-related risk at an accepted level.
5. Optimise the cost of IT services and technology.


Again, it's importantant to observe the focus presented at the high value of **information** for this framework:
1. Order complex standards and frameworks.
2. Extract value from the information chaos.
3. Recognize and address the stakeholders needs.
4. Maximize value for corporate information.
5. Protect and drive the enterprise value.





#### Advantages from the COBIT Framework

1. Strategic planning and IT department alignment
2. Transparency form plans and goals
3. Quality of the service
4. Improve the value of IT operation
5. Productivity
6. Compliance 
7. Risk assessment





#### Principles from COBIT 5

From the ISACA's overview paper:

1. **Meeting stakeholders needs**: since IT correlates to different parts of the administration, from strategic planning to the daily IT process, it should also meet the expectation of each involved part.
2. **Covering the enterprise end to end**: since IT process spread across all the departments and operations, it is necessary that each and all of them should account to the IT assets and their assessment to the strategic plannig.
3. **Applying a single integrated framework**: meaning that even when COBIT is used together with other frameworks, they should all be integrated to cover a broader, but single IT Governance and Management.   
  3.1. And, considering the some of the objectives presented at the ISACA's overview paper, the COBIT framework could be that instrument to act as a _"overarching governance and management framework integrator"_ (p. 20).   
4. **Enabling a holistic approach**: this should imply that the effort with IT Governance and Management should involve every diverse field of the organizations:   
  4.1. Departments or Organisational Structures: this are the _"key decision-making entities"_ in and organization (p. 23)
  4.2. Activities or Service Infrastructure Applications: this are the processes designed for certain objectives and to produce related goals.     
  4.3. Resources, financial assets, principles, polices and frameworks: this are some general vehicles for guidelines.   
  4.4. Culture, Ethics, Behaviour, etc.: this are sets of individual and organization factors that are _"very often underestimated as a success factor in governance and management activieties"_ (p. 23)   
  4.5. People, Skills and Competences: this are the engines and the links that drive the activities, and make up for their correctness and corrective goals.
5. **Separating Governance from Management**: here, there is the importance of creating some layers in the operation, and to separate each concern accordingly.  
  5.1. So, from one side there should be the evaluation of the quality and security on a day-by-day basis for the management of processes,   
  5.2. And, from the other side the necessity for the  monitoring and evaluation of strategic goals and its related the value that should be achieved.





#### Domains (or Functionalities) and Processes from COBIT 5

From this image by ISACA's overview paper (p. 28), it is possible to observe both the COBITs **Domains** and its related **Processes** that work together to sustain the enterprise governance:

![COBIT framework Domains and its related Processes](/images/articles/security/cobit-domains-and-processes-graph.png)
- `COBIT 5 ISACA’s new framework for IT Governance, Risk, Security and Auditing An overview`. (p. 4)


So, in terms of its **Domains**, the COBIT framework works to reach the enterprise end-to-end, covering from Stakeholders until operations and its necessary monitoring:
1. **Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM)**
2. **Align, Plan, and Organise (APO)**
2. **Build, Acquire, and Implement (BAI)**
3. **Deliver, Service, and Support (DSS)**
4. **Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess (MEA)**
