### Introduction

The Spiral Model is a very important life cycle model because it provides support for **Risk Handling**. This life cycle model was initially proposed by boehm as a evolutionary process that couples the iterative feature of prototyping with the more controlled and systematic approach of the linear sequential model.

A very interesting feature in the model is the fact that some metadata and properties of the project can be depicted in a spiral graph, where `The Radius of the spiral at any point represents the expenses(cost) of the project so far, and the angular dimension represents the progress made so far in the current phase.`

### Spiral Model phases

Each cycle of the Spiral Model is divided into four quadrants:

1. Object setting: each cycle in the Spiral model starts with the identification of its purpose, together with the possible alternatives for the targets and the constraints that may exist.
2. Risk Assessment and Reduction: this phase focus in measuring the risk perception for the alternatives proposed at the settiling of the project objectives.
	2.1. And at the end of this phase a prototype is built with the best solution.
3. Developing and Validation: this phase starts development together with all the necessary validations to resolve the risks and uncertainties assessed.
	3.1. At the end of this phase (or quadrant) a new version of the software is presented.
4. Planning: the phase for reviewing the project with the customers and to decide whether should be a new cycle for the spiral model.


### When to use Spiral Model?

- When deliverance is required to be frequent.
- When the project is large.
- When requirements are unclear and complex.
- When changes may be required at any time.

### The Spiral Model is also Known as Meta Model

Also interesting in this model is the fact that it implies and uses aspects of all the other life cycle model, as it is presented in the site of GeeksforGeeks:

`The Spiral model is called a Meta-Model because it subsumes all the other SDLC models. For example, a single loop spiral actually represents the Iterative Waterfall Model. The spiral model incorporates the stepwise approach of the Classical Waterfall Model. The spiral model uses the approach of the Prototyping Model by building a prototype at the start of each phase as a risk-handling technique. Also, the spiral model can be considered as supporting the evolutionary model â€“ the iterations along the spiral can be considered as evolutionary levels through which the complete system is built.`

### Advantages of the Spiral Model

- High amount of risks analysis.
- Useful for large and mission-critical projects.
- Flexibility into the reassignment of requirements: changes in the request, even at a later phase, are not a hindrance for this model.
- The client can see results in the project since an early cycle and then at each new "recycling" of it.

### Disadvantages of the Spiral Model 

- It can become a costly model to be used.
- The risks analysis demand high expertise and the project would prone to fail without the presence of experts.
- Doesn't work well with smaller projects because of its costs.
- It's difficult for time management: as the number of phases is unknown at the start of the project, it is difficult to apply some estimation.
