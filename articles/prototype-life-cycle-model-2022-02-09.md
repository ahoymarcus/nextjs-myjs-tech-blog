### Introduction

The Prototype Model is a methodology that makes effort to bring the customer closer to the developer team by means of implementing some kind of toy or mockup feature that should help the client to have a general visualization of the final product.

As a prototype, the mockup feature tends to be only a crude version of the actual system or some graphic design made with some especialized tool, but it might help to bring the client to the project and help in the gethering of requirements.

### Prototype Model phases

1. **Requirement gathering and analysis**:
2. **Quick decision**:
3. **Prototyping**:
4. **Assessment or User evaluation**:
5. **Prototype refinement**:
6. **Implementation**:

### Advantages of the Prototype Model

1. Reduces the risk of incorrect user requirements
2. It's suitable where requirements are unknown or changing or uncommited
3. It's more flexible and allow changes
4. The use of visualization in the phases of software development
5. Reduces maintenance cost
6. Errors can be detected earlier 
7. Ideal for developing user interfaces and complex interfaces

### Disadvantages of the Prototype Model

1. Speacial tools and knowledge are required to build a prototype
2. Prototyping tolls are expensive
3. That the unstable/crude prototype may shape the final product
4. Requires extensive customer collaboration     
	4.1. Represents an aditional cost to the client     
	4.2. Demands commitment from the client      
		Would be difficult to finish if the client   
	4.3. withdraw the developing process       
	4.4. May turn the software to much "custumer specific" and not suitable to a broader market   
5. Difficult to know how long the project will last, specially with the addition of this second iteration to create make the prototype
6. It's a time consuming process
7. Poor documentation because the continuous changing with the requirements
