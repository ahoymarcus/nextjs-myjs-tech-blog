### Introduction

As stated in the [TutorialsPoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kanban/index.htm) site, Kanban is a management method for teams and organizations that works through visualization to facilitate the identification and the elimination of bottlenecks and improve development/operation and quality.

As a name, Kanban is a Japanese word meaning "visual card" and just like the Lean Development Method, it came originally from Toyota to try to limit the amount of inventory appended on the work process.

So, as a method Kanban is said to reduces both the excess of inventory, just like the effort to produce those excessives inventories.

### The Core Concept

1. Visual workflow
	1.1. Split the work into different columns to define segments or states.
	1.2. Specify each item as as a named visual card to be put in a segment/state of the workflow.
2. Limit Work In Progress (WIP): 
	2.1. Apply explit limit to the number of items currently on the work flow.
	2.2. An item can only advance in the workflow when a segment/state slot becomes vacant.
3. Measure the Lead Time (or Cycle Time): so, that's the act of measuring the average time to complete one item, and then optiize to make the Lead Time as small and as predictable as possible.

### Kanban and Lean Practices

Among the various frameworks working beside Lean Practices, Kanban has been the most effective:

- It visually indicates states.
- It visually indicates when issues/process should start and stop.
- It's a very economic model.
- It's flexible to shape it according to customer demand.

Other benefits:

- Bottlenecks also become visuble in real-time: so collaboration can greatly optimazed.
- Very useful in operations where already exists a high rate of uncertainty and variability.
- Reduction of inventory in the range of 25%-75%.
- Since the states are visuble, the wait time also is reduced.
- Overproduction of inventory is avoided, and them saving resources and eliminating waste.


### The Pull Approach

When there are more than one team working in parallel and one of them is more performing, to avoid friction in the state of the items, the framework allows the creating of **Buffer** to add  `limited capacity between the two teams`.

#### Advantages of the Pull Approach

- Avoids piling-up of work
- Reduces the wait time
- Facilitates a team to maintain constant pace and focus on quality
- Provides resource balancing

### Advantages of the Kanban Method

1. Minimizes cycle time: through otimization of the operation
	1.1. Bottlenecks are identified immediatly and could be easly resolved in a collaborative manner.
2. Continous delivery:
	2.1. Short releases time
	2.2. Continuous feedback from the customer
	2.3. Limiting the burden of excessive requirements each cycle
	2.4. Improving quality through a balanced operation pace 
3. Apply visual metrics

### Applying Visual Metrics

Besides the visual operation process, the Kanban facilitates to create metric over the number of issues and the number of states to create advanced visualizations.

Bellow, we have in Y the number of items and in X the number of days. The color chart easly give us ability to read the total number of items in relation to what was already done and what is being done ([TutorialsPoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kanban/index.htm)):

### The Elimination of Waste

In software development, there are 3 types of waste:

1. **Waste in code development**
2. **Waste in project management**
3. **Waste in team potential**

### Kanban Board

The Kanban Board visualy depict the flow of task to all the team:

- Provides easy access to everyone involved
- Facilitates communication and thus the collaboration too
- The progress of the task are easier to follow through
- The bottlenecks are also easy to be visualized, and thus resolved through collaboration

The basic states are:

1. **To Do**
2. **Doing**
3. **Done**

The extended markings are:

1. **WIP Limit**: the value that visualy limits the number of current items in progress.
2. **Pull Approach**: the buffer the allows two teams use one board giving some slack to avoid friction of performance between teams.


### Kanban and Scrum - Differences Table

Both pratices are Agile, but here some differences ([tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kanban/kanban_scrum.htm)):
