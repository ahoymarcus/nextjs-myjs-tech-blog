### Introduction

As it is stated at the [tutorialsPoint article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/index.htm), Software Architecture typically refers to bigger structures of a  software system, and how its smaller software components manage to carry out their tasks.

Also, it is possible to divide this great concept into two parts constituents:

1. **Software Architecture**: at this phase there should be a gathering of many specifications and items to be correlated into a systems functional requirements.  
2. **Software Design**: at this phase the functional requirements are accomplished.   


### Software Architecture and Software Design

Software Architecture ` serves as a blueprint for a system. It provides an abstraction to manage the system complexity and establish a communication and coordination mechanism among components.`
[tutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/index.htm)


#### Software Architecture

1. It defines a structured solution to meet all the technical and operational requirements, while optimizing the common quality attributes like performance and security.
2. Further, it involves a set of significant decisionas about the organization related software development and each of these decisions can have a considerable impact on quality, maintainability, performance, and the overall success of the final product. These decisions comprise of:
	2.1. Selections of structural elements and their interfaces by which the system is composed.
	2.2. Their behaviour as specified in collaborations among those elements.
	2.3. Composition of these structural and behavioral elements into large subsystem.
	2.4. Architectural decisions align with business objectives.
	2.5. Architectural style guide the organization.
	
	
#### Software Design

`Software design provides a design plan that describes the elements of a system, how they fit, and work together to fulfill the requirement of the system.`
[tutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/index.htm)


The objectives of having a design plan are:

- To negotiate system requirements, and to se expectations with customers, marketing, and management.
- Act as a blueprint during the development process.
- Guide the implementation tasks, coding, integration, and testing.


In terms of the Software Life Cycle, this phase of Software Design would come just after the **domain analysis**, the **requirement analysis**, and **risk analysis**, but before the **detailed documenting** of the system, and also its **coding**, and **testing**.


#### Software Architecture Goals

The **primary goal** of the architecture is to identify requirements that affect the structure of the application.

Other goals:

- Expose the structure of the system, but hide its implementation details.
- Realize all the use-cases and scenarios.
- Try to address the requirements of various stakeholders.
- Handle both functional and quality requirements.
- Reduce the goal of ownership and improve the organizations's market position.
- Improve quality and functionality offered by the system.
- Improve external confidence in either the organization or system.


#### Software Architecture Limitations

`Software architecture is still an emerging discipline within software engineering`.
[tutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/index.htm)

So it has the following limitations:

- Lack of tools and standardization ways to represent architecture.
- Lack of analysis methods to predict whether architecture will result in an implementation that meets the requirements.
- Lack of awareness of the importance of architectural design to software development.
- Lack of understanding of the role of software architect and poor communication among stakeholders.
- Lack of understanding of the design process, design experience and evaluation of design.


### Common Quality Attributes for Software Architecture

The [TutorialsPoint's article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/introduction.htm) also presents a complete table with **Common Quality Attributes** that a **Software Architecture** should have:

1. **Design Qualities**:    
	1.1. Conceptual integrity: defines the consistency and coherence of the overall design.          
	1.2. Maintainability      
	1.3. Reusability       
2. **Run-time Qualities**:     
	2.1. Interoperability: the ability of a system to successfully communiate and exchange information with external systems from other parties.     
	2.2. Manageability: how easy it is to administrate.        
	2.3. Realiability     
	2.4. Scalability     
	2.5. Security     
	2.6. Performance     
	2.7. Availability
3. **System Qualities**     
	3.1. Supportability: the ability of the system to provide information helpful for identifying and resolving issues.    
	3.2. Testability: measure of how easy and simple it is to create test criteria for the system and its components.     
4. **User Qualities**    
	4.1. Usability     
5. **Architecture Quality**     
	5.1. Correcteness: it is the attibute of accountability for satisfying all the requirements defined for the system.       
6. **Non-runtime Quality**:      
	6.1. Portability       
	6.2. Integrity: the ability to make separately developed components of the system work correctly together.       
	6.3. Modifiability: the ease with which a software system can accomodate changes to its software.    
7. **Business Qulity Attributes**:     
	7.1. Cost and Schedule: the costs in respect to time to market, its lifetime and utilization legacy.         
	7.2. Marketabiity
