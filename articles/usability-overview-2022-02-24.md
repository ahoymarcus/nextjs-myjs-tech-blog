### Introduction

According Jakob Nielsen's article, [Usability 101: Introduction to Usability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/), **Usability** is a quality attribute from software engineering to assess `how easy user interfaces are to use`.

And author goes on saying that the word **usability** can also be used to refers the methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.

So, usability has in its definition 05 qualities components that are implied:

1. **Learnability**: focuses on the easeness for the users to accomplish basic tasks from the first time they encounter some design.
2. **Efficiency**: it focuses on the practicability of some design, measuring the quickness for the user to perform a known task.
3. **Memorability**: this attribute focuses on the quention whether it is easy to the users to reestablish proficiency after some period away from interacting with the design.
4. **Errors**: this attribute focuses on anwsering questions about the amont and the kind of users errors related with some design (i.e. How many? Are they severe? etc.).
5. **Satifation**: this attributes focuses on measuring the state of pleasantness from the user with the desing.

Besides, those 05 usabilities attributes, there is also another kind of quality attribute defined as **Utility**, and this is another important quality issue, and should work parallel to **Usability** so a product can be seem as successful.

The relationship of **Usability** to **Utility**, and how they are equally important in all this matter can be show by this two hypothetical arguments:

1. A design can be hypothetically easy and pleasent to use, but it does not work the desired requirement. So, it is not successful design!
2. On the other hand, a interface can work the desired effect wanted by the user, but it is done in such a way that it makes things hard or even impossible to the user to attain the desired result. So, also this is not a successful design!


`To study a design's utility, you can use the same user research methods that improve usability.`
[Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)


### The Importance of Usability

That in many software products, usability is a necessary condition for survival, meaning that websites difficult to use, or homepages that fails on clarity, informations that are hard to grasp, they all result in lost opportunities with the user.

And the same pattern repeats all around, just like in lost purchases in e-commercies, loss of employee productivity at the organization platform, etc. 

`Current best practices call for spending about 10% of a design project's budget on usability. On average, this will more than double a website's desired quality metrics (yielding an improvement score of 2.6) and slightly less than double an intranet's quality metrics. For software and physical products, the improvements are typically smaller — but still substantial — when you emphasize usability in the design process.`
[Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)


### How to Improve Usability

Usually, there are many methods for studing usability, but some of the most basic and useful methods would be **User Testing**, which has 3 components:

1. Gathering of representative users from some system.
2. Testing how these users perform with the design.
3. Observation on what the users do, their accomplishments and also their failures with the design.


Regarding to **User Testings** Nielsen also points to some important points to be held by the user testing:
 
1. The representative users should work individually and solve problems on their own without any kind of interference from outside.
2. Most of time it might be more performatic to test for the most important problems and directing small iterative tests, then to run a hard and expensive study.


### When to Work on Usability

The role of **Usability** in the software life cycle is another point that Nielsen emphasizes, as it should play its role in every stage of the software design process.

Not only this, but still according the author, the simple decision to defer user testing till later in the software design could amount a impossible batch of problems to fix, and even causes structural problems that could demand a rearchitecting maneuver.

And to inform this iterative approach he says that fast and cheap individual studies would brings flexibility to the project:

1. **Testing the old design**: and before starting a new design, to identify the good parts that should be ketp or emphasized, and also the bad parts to be careful with.
2. **Test your competitors' designs**: a way to have cheap data on a range of alternative interfaces.
3. **To Conduct Field Study**: since most of the focus of Usability is on the user, it's important to actually know his true environment.
4. **Make Paper Prototypes**: Nielsen seems to imply that smaller, simpler, and cheapers prototypes could be less time and resource consuming, and still bring all the essential data desired.
5. **Iterate the Test Design**: starting from very low-fidelity prototypes till high-fidelity ones, it would be important to have this continous testing approach.
6. **Established Usability Guidelines**: says Nielsen that it should be very important to inspect the design relative to the guidelines (from earlier studies to published research).
7. **Test the Final Degign**: finally, even in the final stage subtle usability problems could creep in during implementation.


### Usability Testing or User Testing

According Nielsen, the two expressions are interchangeble, except that the term User Testing could convey two distinct meanings:

1. Testing with the help of the user.
2. Testing the user himself.

But it's clear that the objective with the software User Testing is to test the interface, and never the user.

`In a usability-testing session, a researcher (called a “facilitator” or a “moderator”) asks a participant to perform tasks, usually using one or more specific user interfaces. While the participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback.`
[Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)


### Why Usability Test?

In general there are 3 essential goals involved:

1. **Identifying problems**
2. **Uncovering opportunities to Improve**
3. **Learning about the Target User's Behavior and Preferences**

Also, another important point to be noticed is the concern with the complexities from the design:

- It needs to be broke up into smaller parts to be delt interatively.   
- That the user case has to be driven by observations of real user in their own interations.


### The Elements of Usability Testing

The author speaks that might be many different types of usability testing, but that 3 should be the its core elements:

1. **The Facilitator**: the facilitator is the one responsible to prepare the environment and present the tasks. 
	1.1. He could even follow the tests with questions to elicit more details from the participants.
2. **The Tasks**: these should be concrete and real life tasks related to the system or to the business model.
	2.1. Careful **Task Wording**, because small errors in the phrasing of a task could bring misunderstanding from the participant or even influence his performance.
3. **The Participants**: these are the one who have to perform the tasks by themselves, without help.
	3.1. The participants should be realistic users or at least they should have a close background with the real user of the interface could be.

### Types of Usability Testing

There are two kinds of measures for **Usability Testing**: **Qualitative** or **Quantitative**:    
1. **Qualitative usability testing**: focuses on collecting insights and finding problems. And it is the more common type seem.
2. **Quantitative usability testing**: focuses on collecting metrics to describe the user experience. 
	2.1. Two of the most common metrics found are **Success** and **Time**.  
	2.2. The quantitative usability testing is best for collecting benchmark.


### Remote Vs In-Person Testing

Remote usability tests are popular because they often are less time and money consuming, and usually have two types:
1. **Remote Moderated**: it is similar to in-person studies, where the facilitator still interacts with the participant and ask questions.
2. **Remote Unmoderated**: in this case it is often used on-line remote-testing tools that allow the participant to complete the tasks and the questions alone and on their own time.
	2.1. At the end of the session, the researcher receives a recording of the session, along with metrics from it.

### Costs and Where to Test

About the costs, usually it can start as a very inexpesive alternative, where most of time there is some kind of gratification to the few participants involved.

And still according to Nielsen'n [article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/), the most basic and essential conditions for the testing are simple: some dispositive, like a notepad, **real users** are the only essential requirements envolved.

As with the rest, in the cases where testing are vary frequently, it would be plausible to mount a laboratory, but most of other cases a conference room or a office where the the user could have privace would suffice.

Eventhough, sometimes it can become more expensive says the author, and many related things could amount to the cost of the tests:

- Competitive testing of multiple designs.
- International testing in multiple countries.
- Testing with multiple user groups.
- Quantitative studies.
- Use of fancy equipament like eyetrackers.
- The need for a stacked testing lab or a focus group room for obeservations.
- The need of detailed analysis and reports about the findings and observations.



### Differents Methods for Usability Testing


1. **Remote Unmoderated**: this one is cheaper and can gather a lot of information, but it requires very clear set of instructions for the users.
2. **Moderated**: it could be either presential or remote, it's guided and also allow the researcher to dig deeper into the behavior of the user and to the validation of the data being collected.    
	2.1. It's important to point that in this guided testing, the research team can guide the users through more complicated settings. 
3. **Guerilla Testing**: in this method participants are chosen at random from public places to perform quick and simple tests in exchange for some small incentive.
4. **Lab Usability Testing**: this one is a more expensive kind of testing since it demands a proper laboratory to be arranged, but it also allow a more controlled environment.    
	4.1. It could have been auxiliary researches or even stackholders participating behind a one-way mirror.   
	4.2. The more controlled test helps to achieve the same conditions throughout the whole set of participants.
5. **Card Sorting**: in this method the researches place cards with contents or features and allow the participants to arrange the cards into groups and categories.   
	5.1. At any interaction the moderator can ask the participants to explain the logic or resoning for their choises.   
	5.2. This could be an excelent method for prioritizing content and features in the user interface.
6. **Tree Testing**: also known as **reverse card sorting** or **closed card sort**, and involves asking participants to group cards/items within a already defined set of categories.   
	6.1. This one also allow the moderator to question about the participants choises.   
	6.2. And this one could be very appropriated to test navigation designs and confirm its soundness.
7. **A/B Testing**: this is a more general method of testing that put two systems version side by side. But as a kind of usability test, it plays as a experimentation to see which version is most effective to the users.    
8. **5-Second Test**: this method is concerned with the users first impressions, and it's capable to collect a substantive amount of data.   
	8.1. This method could be appropriated to test if the participants can correctly grasp the contexts and messages conveyed by the design.
9. **Eye Tracking**: this method tracks the users eye focus and can effectively capture the users attention points.  
	9.1. And it can also measure the users moviments with the cliks of mouse and also their motions to hovers the elements.   
	9.2. It's also effective to test how the participants can interact with the design.
10. **Screen Recording**: this method utilises software to record the actions of the participants performing the tasks.    
	10.1. It can also be used for testing how effective is the interation of the user with the design.
11. **Heuristic Evaluation** of **Expert Reviews**: in this method the design is evaluated against accepted usability principles and potential usability issues. And also evaluated by experts in usability.
12. **Scenarios Testing**: this method uses scenarios to describe a set of situations related with the users or with the users' goals.     
	12.1. The necessity to limite the number of scenarios to accomodate the time frame.  
	12.2. The testing scenarios should never include any information about how the users should accomplish the tasks, because the users have to be tested own their own.
