### Introduction

The name Agile Model is related to a swift or versatile process, and as a methodology this model is based at the iterative model of development.

The iterations are of a short length, about one to four weeks, and the entire project is divided into smaller parts, what in turn minimize the risks of the project.

Also, each software cycle includes all the necessary phases: planning, requirement analysis, design, coding, testing and the implementation of a working system.

Finally, it interesting to observe that in some terms the Agile Model evolved into a kind of develoment culture with a whole set of concepts, like Frameworks and Practices, that that part in all its environment. 

### Agile Model phases

1. **Requirements gathering**: definition of the requirements for the project, explanation of the business model and the planning technical, economical and of schedule.
2. **Design the requirements**: after the due definition of the requirements, this phase prepares high level documents to presents the new system.
3. **Construction/Iteration**: the software starts to be produced and it is incremented along the many cycles of the project.
4. **Testing/Quality assurance**: aims to test performance and corrects bugs. 
5. **Deployment**: at this phase the team delivers a system to the user's work environment for testing.
6. **Feedback**: it is the feedback from the user about the product that was released and it is operational.

### Agile Testing Methods

- Scrum
- Crystal
- Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM)
- Feature Driven Development (FDD)
- Lean Software Development
- eXtreme Programming (XP)

#### Scrum

It is a Agile development process that focuse to manage taks in team-based conditions, and there are 3 key roles:

1. **Scrum Master**: a kind of guidance for the working team.
2. **Product owner**: this role is responsible to make the product backlog, to reduce the requirementes if needed and it is responsible for the distribution of functionality on each incrementation.
3. **Scrum team**: the team is responsible for the work, or even to reorganize internaly, to complete the sprint or cycle.

#### eXtreme Programming (XP)

This type of methodology is used when customers are constantly changing demands or requirements, or when there are some systems issues (like performance, etc...).


#### Crystal

There is 03 concepts of this methodology:

1. Chartering: multi activities involving making a development team, performing feasibility, analysis, developing plans, ect...
2. Cyclic delivery: 
	2.1. Team updates for the release plan.
	2.2. Integrated product delivered to the users.
3. Wrap up: at the user environment, this phase performs deployment and post-deployment.

#### Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM)

This methodology aims even more agility bringing the clients/users to the development to allow the developers a bigger span to decide. The techniques use here are:

1. Time boxing
2. MoSCoW Rules
3. Prototyping

The DSDM contains seven stages:

1. Pre-project
2. Feasibility Study
3. Business Study
4. Functional Model Iteration
5. Design and Build iteration
6. Implementation
7. Post-project

#### Feature Driven Development (FDD)

This methodology focuses on "Designing and Building" features. In contrast to other smart methods, FDD describes the small steps of the work that should be obtained separately per function.

#### Lean Software Development

The Lean software development methodology follows the principle of "Just in Time Production". The Lean method indicates the increasing speed of software development and reducing costs. And the Lean development can be summarized in 07 phases:

1. Eliminating Waste
2. Amplifying learning
3. Defer commitment (deciding as late as possible)
4. Early delivery
5. Empowering the team
6. Building integrity
7. Optimize the whole

### Why Agile?

`The conventional software models such as Waterfall Model that depends on completely specifying the requirements, designing, and testing the system are not geared towards rapid software development. As a consequence, a conventional software development model fails to deliver the required product. This is where agile software development comes to the rescue. It was specially designed to curate the needs of the rapidly changing environment by embracing the idea of incremental development and developing the actual final product.`

#### Agile Principles

1. Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. It welcomes changing requirements, even late in development.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shortest timescale.
4. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and the support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
5. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
6. Simplicity the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.
7. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

### When to use the Agile Model?

- When frequent changes are required.
- When a highly qualified and experienced team is available.
- When a custumer is ready to have meetings with a software developer team regularly.
- When the project size is small.
- When you can depend on less documentation


### Advantages of Agile Method

- Fequent Delivery
- Face-to-Face communication with the clients
- Efficient design and fullfilment of the business requirements
- Changes are accepted at any time
- Reduction of the overall development time

### Disadvantages of Agile Method

- Due to the shortage of formal documents, it creates confusion and crucial decisions taken throughout various phases can be misinterpreted in different occasions with different team members.
- Due to the lack of proper documentation, once the project completes and the developers are alloted to other projects, maintenance of the finished project can become increasely difficult.
