### Introduction

The the Capability Mature Model Integration or CMMI is a sucessor of the CMM, in the sense that it aims to incorporate all the individual disciplines for the development of software (Software CMM, System Engineering CMM, People CMM, etc) and integrate them all together.

On a side note, CMM was developed for Sotware Development and Maintenance, but later it broadens its reaches ([TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cmmi/cmmi_overview.htm)):

- System Engineering
- Supplier Sourcing
- Integrated Product and Process Development
- People CMM
- Software Acquisition

And in a broader spectrum the CMMI aims for optimizing development processes, to allows its continous improvement, enhance the organization culture, decrease risks, etc.

#### What is Maturity? 

Though it may vary, but generally it is thought to be:

- Well-defined
- Repeatable
- Measured
- Analysed
- Improved
- Effective


### History of CMMI

As it was said, it was developed to combine the multiple business maturity models from CMM into one framework. Tush, while CMM was developed between 1987 e 1997 by Carnegie Mellon Unv and the US Defense Department, the CMMI started in 2002 with its first version:

1. Version 1.1 in 2002
2. Version 1.2 in 2006
3. Version 1.3 in 2010
4. Version 2.0 in 2018

Acording to White's article at [Cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/274530/process-improvement-capability-maturity-model-integration-cmmi-definition-and-solutions.html), along its development the CMMI has shift from a specialized tailoring for software engineering to become more abstract and more generalized and `allowing it to be applied to hardware, software and service development across every industry`.

### Objectives of CMMI

1. **Fullfilling customer needs and expectations**: costs and schedule are validated against customer needs.
2. **Value creation for investors/stockholders**: the recognition for excellence.
3. **Market growth is increased**: quality, pricing, image all builds the reputation and commitments.
4. **Improved quality of products and services**: as quality is also a essential point, the application of quality processes, management, quality assurance, verification and validation.
5. **Enhanced reputation in industry**: beside the enhancement of product quality, predictable schedules, effective measurements all bring support to management and value for the whole organization.

### CMMI Maturity Levels

Just as its predecessor CMMI is a five-level stage process:

1. **Level 1 - Initial**: at this stage processes are viewed as unpredictable and reactive. So, delays and over budget pile up, just as risks increase.
2. **Level 2 - Managed**: at this stage there is already a project management achieved with planning, measurements and control.
3. **Level 3 - Defined**: at this stage, organizations should be more proactive than reactive, with a more clear understanding of its own processes and aiming to improve its dependencies and goals.
4. **Level 4 - Quantitatively managed**: at this stage, the organization widens its to reaches its own management processes and strength them with a more measured and controlled data-driven insight.
5. **Level 5 - Optimizing**: at this stage the organization is already more stable and flexible with its processes, so it aims for continous improvement.
