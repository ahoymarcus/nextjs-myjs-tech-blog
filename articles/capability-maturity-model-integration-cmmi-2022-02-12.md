### Introduction

The the Capability Mature Model Integration or CMMI is a sucessor of the CMM, in the sense that it aims to incorporate all the individual disciplines for the development of software (Software CMM, System Engineering CMM, People CMM, etc) and integrate them all together.

On a side note, CMM was developed for Sotware Development and Maintenance, but later it broadens its reaches ([TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cmmi/cmmi_overview.htm)):

1. System Engineering
2. Supplier Sourcing
3. Integrated Product and Process Development
4. People CMM
5. Software Acquisition

And in a broader spectrum the CMMI aims for optimizing development processes, to allows its continous improvement, enhance the organization culture, decrease risks, etc.

#### What is Maturity? 

Though it may vary, but generally it is thought to be:

- **Well-defined**
- **Repeatable**
- **Measured**
- **Analysed**
- **Improved**
- **Effective**


### History of CMMI

As it was said, it was developed to combine the multiple business maturity models from CMM into one framework. Tush, while CMM was developed between 1987 e 1997 by Carnegie Mellon Unv and the US Defense Department, the CMMI started in 2002 with its first version:

1. Version 1.1 in 2002
2. Version 1.2 in 2006
3. Version 1.3 in 2010
4. Version 2.0 in 2018

Acording to White's article at [Cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/274530/process-improvement-capability-maturity-model-integration-cmmi-definition-and-solutions.html), along its development the CMMI has shift from a specialized tailoring for software engineering to become more abstract and more generalized and `allowing it to be applied to hardware, software and service development across every industry`.

### Objectives of CMMI

1. **Fullfilling customer needs and expectations**: costs and schedule are validated against customer needs.
2. **Value creation for investors/stockholders**: the recognition for excellence.
3. **Market growth is increased**: quality, pricing, image all builds the reputation and commitments.
4. **Improved quality of products and services**: as quality is also a essential point, the application of quality processes, management, quality assurance, verification and validation.
5. **Enhanced reputation in industry**: beside the enhancement of product quality, predictable schedules, effective measurements all bring support to management and value for the whole organization.

### CMMI Maturity Levels

Just as its predecessor CMMI is a five-level stage process:

1. **Level 1 - Initial**: at this stage processes are viewed as unpredictable and reactive. So, delays and over budget pile up, just as risks increase.
2. **Level 2 - Managed**: at this stage there is already a project management achieved with planning, measurements and control.
3. **Level 3 - Defined**: at this stage, organizations should be more proactive than reactive, with a more clear understanding of its own processes and aiming to improve its dependencies and goals.
4. **Level 4 - Quantitatively managed**: at this stage, the organization widens its to reaches its own management processes and strength them with a more measured and controlled data-driven insight improving them to better suit the customer needs.
	4.1. So this distinction that, while here the control of processes needs to be more sophisticated broadering because of the quantitatively predictions, `At maturity level 3, processes are only qualitatively predictable.`([TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cmmi/cmmi_maturity_levels.htm)). 
5. **Level 5 - Optimizing**: at this stage the organization is already more stable and flexible with its processes, so it aims for continous improvement.
	5.1. And both the defined processes and the organizations's set of standard processes are targeted of measurable improvement activities.

#### Maturity Levels Should Not be Skipped

Each maturity level provides necessary foundation for effective implementation of processes at the nest level.

**And all that foundation should be especilly resiliant during periods of crises or stress.**


### SEI CMMI Disciplines

Currently there are 4 bodies of knowledge available:

1. **System Engineering**: this area covers the deployment of complete systems, which may or may not include software. 
	1.1. It has the focus on transforming customer needs, expectations and constraints into solutions.
2. **Software Engineering**: this area covers the development of software systems as a systematic, disciplined and quantifiable process of development, operation and maintanance.
3. **Integrated Product and Process Development**: the Integrated Product and Process Development is a systematic approach to achieve a timely collaboration of relevant stakeholders throughout the life of some product to better satisfy customer needs.
	3.1. And according to [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cmmi/cmmi_models.htm) the choise of IPPD process at an organization implies the to choose also another practice as its object, and it could be either system or software engineering.
4. **Supplier Sourcing**: this is also a area that brings together the complex process of reaching to external peers, in this case suppliers. And since the source of a product is a critical point, this is a important practice as well.
	4.1. And just like the in last case, here also is necessary to couple this pratice with a oject, that could also be either system or software engineering. 

### SEI CMMI Representations

The CMMI is structered like so:

1. **Staged Representation**: this one provides a pre-defined, and fixed, roadmap for organization improvement based on grouping and ordering of processes.       
	1.1. The process is organized by maturity levels.      
	1.2. Appling well know common features to shape and organize the organization generic practices.       
2. **Capability Levels**: this one is related to continous representation and it marks its improvements with the use of Capability Levels, and it is shaped by each organization according with the area of choice and its business model.  
	2.1. Processes are organized through area or categories.     
	2.2. Here values for capabilities are used to organize the many kinds of evalueted practices.   
	
#### Which Representation is Better?

`Each representation has its advantages over the other, some organizations use both representations to address particular requirements at various times in their improvement programs. Organizational maturity is the focus of the staged representation, whereas process area capability is the focus of the continuous representation.`
