### Introduction

The Lean Software Development is an Agile Framework that it is used to streamline and optimize the software development process.

`It may also be referred to as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) strategy as these ways of thinking are very much alike since both intend to speed up development by focusing on new deliverables.`

As it is also stated that originally it was called the Toyota Production System, because Toyota has been credited with its inspiration, and this approach, which is meant for optamizing and reducing waste, came into the software development in 2003, with the famous publication `Lean Software Development` from Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck.

### Key Principles of Lean Software Development

1. Eliminating the waste: eliminate unnecessary codes, features, inefficient communication, data duplication, "more tasks in the log than completed ones", etc...
2. Fast deliveries: cutting complex systems with unwanted features, but including essential functionalities for quick release and latter enhancements according to customer feedbacks.
3. Amplifying learning: cross-team meetings, paired programming, ample code reviewing are some ways in which the learning process is burst out into the process.
4. Quality builds: never sacrificing quality, developers often apply test-driven programming before coding and constant feedback from teammates and project managers.
5. Respect for teamwork: empowering team member through collaborative atmosphere.
6. Delay the commitment: to avoid the threat to deliver products completely unfit to the market, delaying the commitment until the team could make the essential improvements.
7. Optimizing the whole system: it is possible for project managers to break an issue into small parts to simplify and to optimize de development.

### When Shoul Be Used

According to the site Productplan.com, when you have an senior development team that you can trust to tackle this framework.

### Advantages of the Lean Software Development

- For removing the unnecessary stages and simplifing the designing of software.
- Removes risks when it removes valueless builds.
- Increases the involvement of the team members at the project.

### Disadvantages of the Lean Software Development

- Difficulty in making it scale: because is strongly dependent on the team currently involved.
- It's hard to deal with the requirements, so there is more room for conflit within the developers strategies field.
- It also has a strong dependence on the customer feedback for setting the pace onward.


#### Finally
`Lean Software Development is one of the proactive approaches that drives your body through productivity and cleanliness. It closely connects to Agile methodology, knowledge-sharing experience, fast product delivery. All processes and stages of development are accurately built to deliver the end product at minimum cost in a timely manner.`
