### Introduction

ITIL stands for Information Technology Infrastructure LIbrary, and it is a set of best practices for delivering IT services, to maximaze efficiency and bring predictability to the services provided, all in accord with the organization strategic plans.

According to the site [SimpliLearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/itil-key-concepts-and-summary-article), the ITIL has become the de facto standard in IT service management. So, ITIL works around any kind of organization to help them accomplish their services in a quality-driven and economical way.
 

As a framework, is discussion first came into light during the 1980s when the British government realised that they need to improve the quality of their IT services, and sent this demand to the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), now Office of Government Commerce (OGC) to elelaborate some system.

`One of the most essential parts of ITIL is the configuration management database (CMDB), which provides the central authority for all components—including services, software, IT components, documents, users, and hardware—that must be managed to deliver an IT service. The CMDB tracks the location of, and changes to, all of these assets and processes, along with their attributes and relationships to each other. Adhering to ITIL principles helps ensure you can get to the root cause of problems in your environment as quickly as possible and that you have the right visibility into the systems and people to prevent future problems.` [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/it-infrastructure-library)

#### Brief History of ITIL Framework

It was in **1989** that by the name of Government Information Technology Infrastrucure (GITIM) that this framework first came around and started being adopted by public agencies and private companies across Europe as a means to IT services improvement and soon grew to cover 30-volume wide catalog. 


Then, in **2000** came its version 2, which was already present in the US also, for example in the Microsoft operations. This new version aimed specially to make the framework more accessible and started to categorizing the huge 30-volume document into nine related categories.

 
In **2007** came the version 3, the one that brought a new aquired name, ITIL Refresh Project, which was also following the path to make the framework even more friendly when releasing a ITIL Glossary.
 
It was in **2011** that came a revision to the ITIL V3, and besides bringing some corrections to errors and inconsistences with V3, this revision divided again the catalog into 5 areas, reduzing the final catalog to be 5 volumes wide:

1. **ITIL Service Strategy**
2. **ITIL Service Design**
3. **ITIL Service Transition**
4. **ITIL Service Operation**
5. **ITIL Continual Service**


Then, since **2013** ITIL has been owened by AXELOS Ltd and the British Government Office.


Finally, in **2019** came its V4, which continue with the movement in terms of accessibility. In this case, the framework incorporated more practical guidances on how to use the ITIL framework, especially in collaborative environments, what in its turn open the door to the bring the framework closer to the Agile and DevOps philosophies.

#### Basic Concepts of the ITIL Framework

1. Delivering maximum value to customers
2. Optimizing resources and capabilities
3. Offering services that are useful and reliable
4. Planning processes with specifid golas in mind
5. Defining roles clearly for each task


There are also some key ITIL terms:
 
1. **Capabilities**: the specialized skills or abilities an organization applies to resources to create value.
2. **Processes**: these are the structured set of activities which aim for specific goal. Its characteristics:    
    2.1. Transform inputs into outputs.   
    2.2. Deliver results to a specific customer or stakeholder.   
    2.3. They are measurable.   
    2.4. They are triggered by specifc events.
3. **Functions**: these are self-contained processes with specific aims, that usually take the form of a group set and their working tools.
4. **Resources**: the raw materials that are transformed.
5. **Roles**: these a sets of responsabilities and priviledges, and may be held by individuals or groups.
6. **Service Assets**: these are the features in a service.   
7. **Service Management**: a proper analysis and evaluation of the services provided.
8. **Services**: these are the values delivered to the customers.
9. **Value, Utility, and Warranty**: the value is the benefit generated by the service provided. The value is tracked by ITIL in terms of Utility and Warranty:  
    9.1. Utility: also called the fitness for purpose.   
    9.2. Warranty: also called the fitness for use, or in other terms, its reliability.


#### Basic Structure of the ITIL Framework 
 
As it was said above about the revision made to V3 in **2011**, the ITIL catalog was divided into 5 life cycle stages, and there are **24 processes**, and **4 functions**: 
 
1. **ITIL Service Strategy**: this stage brings strategy to the whole life cycle and should be in sync with business objectives. Also, it should present that the service is **fit for purpose** and **fit for use**.   
    1.1. Financial Management: this is the process to that provides analysis over costs and opportunities for service.   
    1.2. Service Portfolio Management: this process maps the service list of the company as Service Pipeline, Service Catalog and Retired Services.    
    1.3. Demand Management: this process is concerned with understanding and influencing customer demand   
    1.4. Strategy Operations: this process aims to analyse values of the service, like user requests, resolving failures, fixing problems, etc.
2. **ITIL Service Design**: the purpose of this life cycle stage is to design the processes for the service.    
    2.1. Service Level Management: process for securing and managing agreements between customers and service provider.   
    2.2. Availability Management   
    2.3. Capacity Management   
    2.4. Continuity Management   
    2.5. Information Security Management: process for securing the 5 qualities of information assets (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, and Nonrepudiation)   
    2.6. Service Catalog Management   
    2.7. Supplier Management: this process deals with the relation between the company and suppliers.
3. **ITIL Service Transition**: this life cycle is concerned with building and deploying IT services and making sure the changes under way are carried out in a coordinated way.    
    3.1. Change Management: this process is to limit disruption.   
    3.2. Asset and Configuration Management   
    3.3. Release  and Deployment Management   
    3.4. Transition Planning and Support   
    3.5. Service Validation and Testing   
    3.6. Evaluation   
    3.7. Knowledge Management
4. **ITIL Service Operation**: this life cycle deals with end-users expectations, for balancing costs, discovering new values and fixing problems.   
    4.1. Service Desk (function): this function is the contact between users and the service provider    
    4.2. Incident Management   
    4.3. Problem Management   
    4.4. Access Management   
    4.5. Event Management   
    4.6. Request Fullfillment   
    4.7. Technical Management (function)  
    4.8. Application Management (function)  
    4.9. IT Operations Management (function)
5. **ITIL Continual Service**: this is the life cycle that is close to the notion of continous  delivering. **It only has one process divides into 7 steps** (7 Step Process Improvement).   
    5.1. Identifying improvement strategies (step)   
    5.2. Defining what will be measured  (step)   
    5.3. Gathering data  (step)    
    5.4. Processing data    
    5.5. Analysing data  
    5.6. Presenting and using the information drawn from the data   
    5.7. Using the information to improve


#### ITIL Incident and Problem Management System

The ITIL framework makes distinction between **Incident Management** and **Problem Management**, where the first one is related to some kind of disrupting event with the client's service and the efforts to reestablish it. The second one is related with prevention error effort for the service.


###### Incident Management

This is an unplanned event that cause disruption to the client's service, and the incident management comes to reinstate the service to it original state as quick as possible.

And also, to determine the root cause for the event, and even if the particular event is possibly connected to other occurrencies:

`Implementing ITIL Incident Management will help you improve service levels, and meet service level availability requirements or a specified service level agreement (SLA).` [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/it-infrastructure-library)


###### Problem Management

As steps to manage problems:

1. Raise a problem management case.
2. Categorize and prioritize issues.
3. Systematically investigate (root cause analysis)
4. Identify changes needed to resolve and work with Change Management.
5. Verify the problem resolution.
6. Close out the problem.


#### Certifications Levels for ITIL
    
The certifications last for 3 years and must be renewed, and there are 5 levels of tranning and certification for ITIL V3:

1. **ITIL Foundation**: covers basic concepts, elements, and terminology.
2. **ITIL Practitioner**: covers the Continual Service Improvement approach and organizational change management, communication, and measurement and metrics.
3. **ITIL Intermediate**: consists of two parts. The Service Lifecycle track focuses on the basics of the core ITIL phases, and the Service Strategy track concentrates on the management of the Service Strategy phase of the Service Lifecycle, with a focus on ITSM.
4. **ITIL Exepert**: requires full understanding and demonstration of the entire ITIL scheme. Passing this level includes completion of the ITIL Managing Across the Lifecycle Capstone Course (MALC).
5. **ITIL Master**: requires five years of leadership in IT service management and a demonstrated ability to apply the principles, methods, and techniques from ITIL in the workplace.
