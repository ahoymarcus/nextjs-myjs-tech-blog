					<p class="testimonial-section__text">Node.js is a cross-platform environment and library for running JavaScript applications which is used to create networking and server-side applications. The definition given by its official documentation is as follows: </p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">It was built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">It also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules to simplify the development of web applications and has features like:</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">I ---  Extremely fast: Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, so its library is very fast in code execution.</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">II --- I/O is Asynchronous and Event Driven: All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous i.e. non-blocking. So a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call. It is also a reason that it is very fast.</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">III --- Single threaded: Node.js follows a single threaded model with event looping.</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">IV ---  Highly Scalable: Node.js is highly scalable because event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way.</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">V --- No buffering: Node.js cuts down the overall processing time while uploading audio and video files. Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">VI --- Open source: Node.js has an open source community which has produced many excellent modules to add additional capabilities to Node.js applications.</p>
					<p class="testimonial-section__text">VII --- License: Node.js is released under the MIT license.</p>
